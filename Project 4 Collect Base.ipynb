The way gear works in the game now after 3.0 heavily encourages you to trade with other players if you ever want to get gear that is useful to your character in the end game. \\n\\nThat in itself isn\\'t a problem, however if you wan\\'t to look for items to trade with other players you have to join the \"official hero siege discord server\". After joining the discord server i slowly started becoming more and more disgusted playing the game, after seeing countless posts by the CEO of Panic Art Studios, Elias Viglione, saying racist, homophobic, sexist and outright violent things about various people/communities. \\nSome of my personal \"favorites\" were things like \"I don\\'t care, i could kill somebody and not feel anything\" and \"I\\'d kill this lil shit with my bare hands if I got the chance\". The entire discord server at this point is just a bunch of moderators talking to each other and circlejerking about how good the game is. Elias doesn\\'t take any criticism at all, everything he does is perfect and the only reason his game isn\\'t more popular is because he is a white male \"Like I said, if you want to win an indie game award or even get nominated you need to have a black transgender midget who is gay and handicapped\" \\n\\nAnd then of course there is the most recent twitter rant where he proclaims that it is now his life goal to kill as many immigrants and n-words as possible, which is what made me come back and write a review for this game. If you\\'re thinking about buying this game, you should at least know what kind of CEO and community that he has built around him, that you will be supporting.',\n",

Just really sucks that the updates made it less enjoyable. \\nAfter creating a character you will have to one shot enemies for literal hours until there's some challenge. It only makes it worse that they disabled changing the difficulty from the get go. After doing around 50 stages you will have to replay them but just with a harder difficulty (like Diablo but not being able to increase it) which isn't bad or new but just sucks that you have to play the easy mode before. \\nEspecially annoying if you realize that the DLC characters you bought suck, so you have to grind the first stages again essentially wasting hours to get to a point where the game gets fun.\\n An easy fix for that would be to allow players to change the difficulty from the start (which I always used to do before it was removed, since normal difficulty is more like one-shot-everything-even-bosses-and-have-no-fun mode). \\nOh and the DLCs are too expensive for what they are. I have bought some back when I had fun with the game but even then they were too little content for too much money. A single character DLC costs almost as much as the game, not worth it. \\nIf you're committed to spend more time than I did you will probably start to have fun at some point, but you first have to get there.\",\n",

There's no challenge involved, the levels and enemies change but it doesn't affect anything at all, there's no story to speak of, and more than half of the playable characters as well as the final act are DLC. You think it's a grind until you get to level 100 and realize the real grinding hasn't even started yet. The only reason I recommend this is as a cheap and totally stress-free time-waster.

       "  'review': \"It's a really fun diablo-esque sort of game. Still being supported by the devs after all this time. Remote play works like a charm, but don't recommend using remote play at above 60hz ingame settings, as higher hz than a monitor allows--or in this case, streaming service--makes the game run a lot slower. This also means if you aren't doing that (or even if you are) make sure you match up the refresh rate of the monitor you're using, and the game's settings.\\nWith pixelated graphics, lowspec PCs should be able to run this fine without problems, even if you might have to lower the settings a tiny bit.\\nI recently got the DLC bundle for the game (which unlocks all the classes and comes with a few extra goodies like skins and doubles inventory/stash space) but the game's fine as a standalone purchase as well. I do recommend at least getting the expansion that comes with demonspawn and demon slayer though as it has an exclusive act/zone that you can play via it.\\nAfter each clear of the maps, you can go up in difficulties, with there being... 6? 7? difficulties from what I hear, with 4 of them being viewable at the start. So far, I've gotten multiple characters up from normal to Nightmare difficulty, nearly got one of them to Hell difficulty, and have not seen Inferno difficulty, which are the first 4 you'd see, from my understanding.\\n\\nEdit: I forgot a quick disclaimer in the original posting. Playing in the official online mode requires a separate account via the devs, which has separate save files than the local gameplay does. There's also a type of online character called Seasonal in order to compete for a season's rewards along with a season-exclusive currency called Rubies.  Once a season ends, from my understanding, those characters are converted to normal ones, and leftover rubies are converted to gems, in order to give an even playing field for people in the new season and such...  Each season typically has big changes that comes with it, lasting about 4 months from my research. As of writing, we're nearing the end of Season 8, with Season 9's content being in an open beta.\",\n",

Quests were not sufficient for a RPG-roguelike game as in they had no purpose whatsoever, you are just as fine if you don't complete them. I would've kept playing if they didn't ask for more money to continue playing after level 49. I don't think neither the game nor DLC's are worth it unless you get it off a discount. Plus they are also selling classes with money? Like c'mon. The game doesn't even have an ''Exit'' button in the menus. You literally press ''Esc'' to quit.\",\n",

Other people have posted using a controller is better, but that shouldn\\'t isn\\'t an acceptable solution. lots of quality of life problems that haven\\'t gotten fixed due to their reasoning \"small development team\" but that isn\\'t a good excuse, the game is only a few steps from greatness, it just needs polish that it isn\\'t getting\\n\\nGame is cross platform between android and PC which is very cool, i bought both versions as it is much more fun on android with proper controls (move with left hand, skills with right hand), however they also expect you to buy your DLC in both places if you expect to use your same account, so expect your characters to locked behind a very expensive paywall on android -which isn\\'t accustomed to the same sales that steam so generously gets. If you ask me double charging for all the DLC i already bought is just greedy.\\n\\nCan\\'t recommend the PC Version until controls are fixed. Can\\'t recommend the android version until prices are fixed. Not recommended',\n",

       "  'review': 'I really enjoyed this game and the way it is designed. It is a 2d ARPG and it is done pretty well. I burst through the game with some friends one summer and really enjoyed it, but going back to it a while ago, I had a harder time. Mainly because you can only attack in four directions (maybe eight and I might just be forgetting) but the problem is this makes the game unnecessarily annoying to control. Besides that, this game is great. The enemies and bosses are well built, item farming is fun, classes are unique and fun, the music is solid, the graphics are well stylized and fun. Overall a good one to try out if you like ARPGs.\\n\\n7/10',\n",

Its a big deal because you get rewards based on which spot on the leaderboard you finish the season as. Well good luck getting any good rewards in this game because the hackers are now giving themselves the best gear in the game and climbing the ranks. It has taken me 300 hours to get the gear I have while they get it in seconds.\\n\\nSome are even editing which WormHole they are on so they can skip how many they have to do to achieve the rank they desire. Recently one guy skipped 500 levels then did the last 400 so it looked legit. Amazing they are just letting it go on.\\n\\nDO NOT buy this game until they have at least implemented a real Anti-Cheat or if you like cheating then this is the game for you!',\n",

I honestly can say that I hated the experience of playing it.\\nIts a real shame, I really enjoyed this game, but as a friend described it, its like they released a sequel to the game, over the original game.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Hero Siege was one of those games I had no intention of playing. It sat in my steam library for a couple of weeks and I glanced over here and there but never really had any intention to play it. That was until the festive season where I was without internet for well over a week and pretty much bedridden.\\n\\nI booted up the game and selected the necromancer. Nice design and well necromancers are generally pretty cool. I played through the very first level where the enemies HP is no greater than seven (7) unless they\\'re enhanced. I reached the part where you\\'re supposed to jump over the gap but I hadn\\'t read the sign to tell me space bar was to jump the sign and thought \"must be a bug I\\'ll try a different character\". Chose pirate, discovered how to use my spacebar for the first time apparently and went off on my journey. Playing on normal difficult, as both pirate and pretty much in general, is quite a breeze and I\\'ve seen a few reviews referencing how easy it is; what some people aren\\'t understanding is both the genre of game and the reasoning behind the normal difficulty. The normal mode is essentially \\'beginner\\' mode where players learn the abilities of their characters, get a feel for boss battles and obtain lower grade loot. \\n\\nIt was once I hit LVL 40 on pirate that I went back to Necromancer; praying for more of a challenge before I discovered what I previously mentioned. I grinded through the game, or so I thought, and hit LVL 100 Necromancer [spoiler]Hero level 0[/spoiler] by the time I finished the final boss, Satan, on normal difficulty. For those of you unaware of what Hero level 0 means it\\'s essentially very similar when you prestige in games like Call of Duty.\\n\\nAny who, the game really starts to pick up once you progress into further more difficult modes such as hell, nightmare and inferno respectively. Once you start interacting with these modes with whichever character you see fit the chances of you unlocking achievements and rare loot increases. Satanic items are only droppable, as far as I\\'m aware, in hell or inferno mode meaning you cannot obtain certain achievements or loot if you do not progress and start doing the REAL grind. \\n\\nOverall, the game is pretty fantastic with good character designs, well-made bosses, hundreds of hours of gameplay if you\\'re up for the grind and overall just a good time. I must clarify also that although it says I have 3.5 hours as of making this guide due to the majority of time I spent was in offline mode it won\\'t account for the 60 hours of offline gameplay time I\\'ve gathered.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Hero Siege actually feels and is incredibly fun for what it's worth. While I'm not a fan of it's beginnings, once being on a tablet/mobile platform. It's transition over to PC was pulled off pretty well and felt nice. I was almost tempted to refund it simply because of that alone. However, I decided to give it more time and for what it's worth, it's a keeper now.\\n\\nThere is simply just a lot packed in here for content and a lot of classes to choose from. There's also a laundry list of DLCs with more classes to choose from, albeit, most of which I would've loved to have been like Samurai, Plague Doctor and Shaman. Oh well, I opted to be Necromancer in this game and that's enough for me before wanting to try other classes. There's at least over 14 classes to pick from, so there's a nice dose of variety.\\n\\nThe visuals for this game is pixel-based, that's nicely detailed and crisp. Except maybe at times for the text up in the upper left hand corner. It looks squished to me and I don't like having to feel like I'd need a magnifying glass to know how much HP I have left.\\n\\nI'm not ever taking this game online, so I cannot say for certain how that experience is. I'm looking for more offline ARPGs and I'm thankful this game gives me the option. For it's single player mode, there's at least 7 Acts to go through, which is more than enough bulk to play on.\\n\\nHero Siege's gameplay is exactly what you'd expect out of the genre you'd come to love. Except, I'm going to come and say that it's arguably one of the more finer pixel-based ARPG/Roguelikes you'll find on Steam. You loot, you do quests, you kill enemies and beat bosses. What more can you ask for?\\n\\nMy only minor gripes with Hero Siege is that controlling the magic attacks, like where the projectile goes, your left control stick goes right for example but the projectile just barely goes diagonal in either horizontal direction. I can't explain what is up with that, but it's a bit getting used to when you're roaming around and shooting enemies down with magic.\\n\\nRecommended.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Sort of recommend it. Great game with lots of interesting classes and skills, early game some classes are far better while other will struggle with not much more than auto attack until lvl 12 or even 24. After that minor inconvenience it only takes a few hours to reach max level and everything is smooth... Right up until you reach the last difficulty which you will by no means be playing for another couple of days as you will need much of your gear to be atleast of the \"satanic\" tier which can take days to get a single piece of in the hell difficulty. And even then there is no guarantee that it is usable by your class or better for your build.\\n\\nIn the games current state the balance is just horrible when reaching endgame. Other than that and the poor information like the dead wikipage, the game is fantastic.',\n",

Now... All I can see is grinding, hour and hours to get a single satanic, if you don't want to do that tho, you can mine ores and use 'em to buy said item, except mining, takes sooo much time and it's sooo f boring, this is not what I paid at all, this game changed too much.\\nI remember how having the max level at this game used to be like, walk around killing everybody with not too many hits, getting items and relics very fast, now is just... Slow and... Frustrating...\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I used to like this game, years ago when I played it for the first time. I felt like playing the game again now, and it seems that the developers have not done a good job.\\nI played as a summoner, and the game just felt very easy. I also played it on normal difficulty, which I know has to be pretty easy. The bosses were ALL extremely boring and easy to kill throughout the whole game. I killed pretty much everything as soon as I saw an enemy.\\nAnd also at the final chapter (without the DLC which unlocks the last chapter and boss I believe) there was a level where I actually died once, and I didn't really know why. The game told me it was an arrow that I died to. Well I entered the level again and the same thing happens, some kind of arrow killed me again. And this actually happened for quite a few times when I actually realised that the 1 arrow (that just randomly appeared?) was doing some kind of bleeding or poison damage, or then it was just a bug.\\nI tanked many arrow shots during the other levels without any problems until that one level, where I randomly just died due taking damage overtime which I was just unable to outheal. Even with a healing item I doubt the healing/bleeding/bug would have ended in time, it was that strong.\\nLike I said, I played the game on normal difficulty and it probably would've been much more difficult on the harder levels, but the gameplay (atleast as a summoner) was really boring. I never had any mana problems and I pretty much ran through the game just holding mouse1 and walking to the next destinations. I don't feel like playing the game again on any other difficulties because of these reasons.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]A simple, but evolving game added to the genre[/h1]\\n\\nI wasn't around when this game originally released on Steam, apparently I'm starting out in Season 8, however, it's been quite awhile since I've played a game that had me thinking and wanting to play more, stay up late on a work night to push a little further, and even ignore homework to get a quick run through some levels before the night was over. You could look at this game, its simple graphic engine that makes you believe it was made with RPG Maker, and understand the developers of this game had World of Warcraft, Diablo, and other heavily familiar games the MMORPG and ARPG players have experienced in mind in terms of fun.\\n\\nWhat I have come to enjoy is the fact you have a large handful of classes to play, some you have to pay for, and run through the game with different variety and outcomes in an already randomly generated field of baddies to kill. I didn't mind buying everything the developers were selling through DLC, I've paid way more for worse content AAA companies pooped out. I think of it as supporting this small company to continue adding to this game, spending more time with areas and new classes to get my hands on. If this isn't enough to some players, well, a lot of the DLC mentioned you could just buy it to buy them an energy drink.\\n\\nDon't expect to bust out campaign hours into the game, though. As enjoyable as this game has been, I can see when it eventually becomes mundane with the long hours of play. It eventually grows into the aspect of a grindfest, some randomized areas begin to appear familiar, and you've recycled through the minibosses and enemies enough you don't seem as thrilled to see them.\\n\\nI've only ran into this issue once, but I don't get to log nearly close to the amount of hours I used to play with video games. (Growing up sucks some times.) I can expect to easily get my money's worth even at the 14 hours I've put in. The game breakdown...,\\n\\n[ulPros:[/u]\\n- Randomization\\n- Plentiful classes to play. (Paywall might annoy some)\\n- Loot a plenty\\n- Music isn't annoying\\n- Dialogue is fun\\n- Skill trees (I hope to see more skills and tree depth increased.)\\n\\n[u]Cons:[/u]\\n- Long hour sessions will get boring\\n- You steamroll through normal as if it isn't needed\\n- Hard to see some floor traps through the chaos\\n- Paywall for new classes/costumes\\n\\n[u]My Score [/u]\\n7/10\",\n",

It\\'s cheap, it\\'s grindy, it\\'s a roguelike hack n\\' slash, what is there not to like? It came a long way since my first time playing, which was on a cracked client, but I thought that devs really deserve the money cause I\\'ve found no bugs at all, the game is really enjoyable and it even has controller support. The only sad part is the dlcs. If you want to play an interesting character, you\\'ll probably want to buy some of those. I\\'m not sure about price-to-value ratio here but I\\'d like to have some more variety in what to play. Oh, and the \"normal\" difficulty setting is much too easy. Try it, if you enjoyed Diablo or Path of Exile, this is the game for you.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Hero Siege misses the mark, mostly caused by the compounding of seemingly small but poor design choices that eventually sum up to a large mess. These issues definitely take some hours with the game to encounter but they are apparent enough now for me that I don\\'t really want to replay the title anymore. Some of these missteps are outlined below:\\n\\n1) Traps/Ground Effects: Throughout the game you\\'ll notice that traps and other ground effects are the most threating source of damage. It appears they are designed to do % of total HP damage, so nothing you do aside avoiding them can reduce the effect. This does a real disservice to the monsters in the game which are usually nothing more than wet noodles. In addition this puts a ton of emphasis of getting a relic that allows the player to \"fly\" over pits, spike traps.etc. IMO the trap damage system should be completely re-thought and then force players to engage in the games content by removing the 3 flying relics.\\n\\n2) Difficulty progression, specifically the transition between the 3rd and final 4th difficulty. At this transition point  an act 1 enemy will go from having 100k HP to more like 2-3M HP. To not get completely wrecked you\\'ll need to farm red satanic items on the 3rd difficulty for a considerable amount of time before being able to progress. This is a overly difficult hurdle (esp for hardcore characters) which needs to be re-visited.\\n\\n3) Screen Clutter. This ties in with #1 but some class skills/attacks create so much screen clutter with their effects that when combined with the enemy effects, traps..etc that it is extremely difficult to see what is happening around you at a given moment.\\n\\nIf these things don\\'t really bother you then you\\'ll probably have a good time in Hero Siege.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Fun hack & Slash Dungeon Crawler akin to Diablo but with great 16bit era/style graphics. Lots of loot to find and a lot of customization when it comes to classes, weapons, and trees. i like the Rouge-like aspect of the game as well. Getting fun little trinkets that change the way the game plays is fun and makes things different. I picked he game up on sale so it made it well worth it. I liked it enough to purchase a class unlock as well.',\n",

I tried out the mobile version and didn't like it, then when I found out there was a PC version I decided to give it another shot and I'm really glad I did.  It fulfills that itch coming off Diablo III burnout, and it fulfills it in such a way that keeps me coming back for more.  \\n\\nThe game is structured as an ARPG and roguelike mashup, so nearly everything is different every single time you play, from map layouts chest placement, enemies, you name it.  The only thing that seems to carry over with you even after you die is any gear you're wearing.  I think that's what keeps me coming back for more, the repetitive grinding nature of two of my favorite genres mashed up into one perfect game.  Hell, I've played it for nearly 100 hours and still feel like I've barely scratched the surface.  I usually don't take the time to review games but I thought I'd give this game the love it deserves.\",\n",

If you read the *full* discord thread ( https://discord.gg/herosiegeofficial - 'report cheaters') they are referencing, there is a bit more to the story. What I see is Elias reacting to misuse of the reporting system and harrassment towards himself, a mod, and other players. Not outlandish at all in context. Besides that, great game.

       "  'review': \"For the purposes of this review, I will be comparing and contrasting this game with a similar much more popular game, Realm of the Mad God. DISCLAIMER: I have never played the multiplayer mode of this game, but I have a basic understanding of how it works.\\n\\nBoth Hero Siege and Realm of the Mad God are RPGs. Realm of the Mad God (ROTMG henceforth) is an MMORPG, while Hero Siege (HS henceforth) just has a party system for multiplayer. In both games, you choose a class, create a character, and begin killing things. The combat works in a similar fashion of aim in a direction and hold your attack button, but HS has slightly more nuance.\\n\\nWhile the classes in ROTMG get different weapon types and one unique ability per class, HS offers not only four active abilities per class, but passives as well. This also comes in the form of a talent tree that you scale when you level up. This gives the combat more nuance as instead of just aiming and holding attack, you also have to decide how to use your abilities and manage your mana and cooldowns. Additionally, the items in ROTMG are limited to potions and equipment; in HS, there are those types, but you also get an active item that functions similarly to your four abilities. There are also relics which are passive items reminiscent of items from the Binding of Isaac, doing anything from raising your stats to giving you the ability to fly to giving you a homing missile turret.\\n\\nIn ROTMG, there are no quests. The goal is to level up to level 20 (the maximum) and then accrue fame before your death. ROTMG uses a roguelite permadeath system. If your character dies, you must start again from scratch. In HS, there are main quests and side quests (the main quests being clearing acts, the side quests being fetch missions mainly), and it is not permadeath. If your character dies, you lose all of your relics, but keep your equipment, levels, gold, and most importantly, your character is still alive. You simply respawn at the town you were last in.\\n\\nIn ROTMG, there is a big economy that you will most likely participate in if looking to fight the final boss. There is a massive trading market in the lobby as there are so many people in the server. In HS, this is not a part of the game, since the most people you can have in one game is like four.\\n\\nThe final element of the games that I will address is the price tag. HS costs seven dollars, while ROTMG is free to play. HS has DLC to give you new characters and new levels (I think?), and I am unsure if ROTMG has any DLC or in game purchases.\\n\\nAs a whole, Hero Siege is a more polished, more nuanced alternative to Realm of the Mad God. Personally, I think it is very much worth the money, but keep in mind that unless you have friends to play with, you'll likely be sticking to single player. If you enjoy RPGs like ROTMG, definitely give this a go. It'll be right up your alley.\",\n",

I logged in for about 2 minutes, instantly banned for \"cheating\", even though I had literally done nothing and just logged in. I have read countless posts about people claiming the same thing. Yet, the Dev decides he doesn\\'t care and doesn\\'t want to do shit about anything. This game is actually pretty fun, but when you have Devs like this, you should definitely stay away from this game. Their system is borked, yet they say \"we are no longer checking bans to see if they are legit because it\\'s a waste of time.\" I didn\\'t realize that your player base getting unfairly banned is a waste of time. Especially after they have supported you with money. I like to support devs who make enjoyable games, but wish there was a way I could get my money back from these people. They just take your money and don\\'t give a shit about what happens. That\\'s horrible customer service and a terrible way to run a game. Also, very selfish. I have waited over 2 weeks for a response through email and tried the discord channel. All the admins just say \"well sorry, nothing I can do. I don\\'t really give a shit that you got banned.\" Then I ask how I am supposed to get a hold of someone higher up and it\\'s like \"oh hopefully he doesn\\'t respond because hes drunk AF right now and he\\'d be super pissed\". Lastly, I read some of his posts and the main Dev Elias will literally curse people out and rage. Who would want to play a game where their Dev is some asshole who doesn\\'t give a shit about any of his player base. As long as he gets his money from them, that is all that matters. Stay away from this game and this toxicity. Check out their discord https://discord.gg/herosiegeofficial and read some of the responses from Elias under \"report-cheater\". \\n\\nOne more thing. I asked about my ban in the discord and my message instantly got deleted. I asked if it wasn\\'t allowed and got linked a thing saying \"We no longer put any time into checking bans, it is pointless and waste of time. If you got banned, you shouldn\\'t have cheated. All ban related posts will be deleted and potentially muted for 24 hours.\" Okay, so the automatic assumption is you cheated and it has nothing to do with their system, even though many have reported it. Oh wait, but then to cover his ass, he deletes all posts about it so that he can hide that people are getting banned for no reason and he will do nothing about it. Just stay away from the game and definitely don\\'t spend any real money and support these people. They don\\'t give a shit about anyone but themselves..',\n",

Now it's as others have said, a weak diablo clone. Now if that was the only issue, I would still recommend it on sale. However, the DEVS are absolute SHITTY people. They don't review bans, even though swapping from mobile/pc or vice versa can trigger an auto ban. They are awful people who don't give a single fuck about their playerbase. Think EA, but with less people and less money.\",\n",

But the new Hero Siege with the item system, seasonal system, and whatever other new mechanics there are, just doesn't feel right.

       "  'review': 'I don\\'t know what to say about this game other than it\\'s great. Definitely worth the sale price of less than $2, and just a couple of weeks ago it was $0.69, or a 4-pack for just under $4. Even at $6.99 it\\'s pretty cheap as I like to value the games by the amount of time I play by dollar value. I just got the game 2 days ago, already beat it on normal, and have 10 hours logged as of right now. I really didn\\'t expect to like it as much, but I couldn\\'t pass up such a great deal. I ended up purchasing one of the DLC\\'s that gives access to another Act, higher difficulties, and 2 new class sets. I can easily see myself playing this for more hours to come. It\\'s categorized as an RPG/Roguelite, but the roguelite elements are REALLY lite. It\\'s more of an action RPG, that has roguelite elements, but I wouldn\\'t categorize it as such unless you\\'re playing in Hardcore Mode. The community from what I\\'ve seen is great and very helpful, always communicating and helping in general in-game chat. So if you see this review before the sale is over I\\'d recommend getting at least the base game and the \"Wrath Of Melvius\" DLC, since you would need that fully complete the game, Act VII, and if you want more of a challenge since that unlocks the feature of higher difficulties as well as 2 additional classes adding to the 8 the base game includes. You can get both right now for less than $4. I\\'d rate this an 8.5/10 easily.\\n\\nEdit: As of recent the Devs have been doing a great job with their recent updates, and post-update patches fixing any issues within a few weeks of said bugs/issues reported.',\n",

My girlfriend and I played this game for damn near 7 hours straight, which some of that time was spent trying to figure out how to play together online on my network. So actually, we're matching level 45 at the time of typing this, and it only took us around 6 hours. The game has humor and charm, so for these people in the comments acting as though they're paid critics, screw them. If you have someone to play with, the game can be fun. All the special items you get are pretty cool. The Duck, which it quacks when you throw it, is by far my favorite item. Now would be a good time to pick it up since it's just over a dollar, or throw another couple of dollars and get all the classes and the skins. It's a no-brainer. I just hope there's more coming to the game down the road.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is just my first impression as I have not invested a large amount of time into it yet. I\\'m an old school player and old timer gamer. I was on this planet to see the birth of the majority of it\\'s greatest forms of video games. I bought this game for myself, and for all of my friends (roughly ten copies) as a means for us to have a fun mmorpg for the weekends because we are old and can\\'t invest the hours required like what we used to 10 years ago. Short story aside, this game feels like they took the best from every RPG game we have played throughout gaming history, and slapped it in one game. It has elements of Diablo, Zelda, Baldur\\'s Gate, FF2 - FF3 - FF7, Earthbound, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, and Mario RPG. My younger brother and I were kids again playing this game and it was a delight. Some boss fights, you will scream out \"Didn\\'t I kick your ass when I was 13?!?!\" and other bosses you will feel are straight up influences from Fullmetal Alchemist. My brother was already on the phone today, telling his gaming friends that they need to jump on the current sale and buy this game now. I\\'m sure there will be glitches or bugs, i\\'m sure there will be some things that require a little tweaking. But out of the box wholesome fun, you just can\\'t beat it. Out of all the games I have played in the last few years, triple A titles included. This one has been one of the best. One last thing, you don\\'t know how many times I have played an RPG and wished for a jump button... And these devs give you a jump button. Well played.\\n\\n*Update* I have seen a lot of ill comments on the \"skins\" and I feel like I should share how you can wear the DLC skins you can buy. The skins are in the shop section and they are titled as a \"hat\". If you own the dlc/skin for that class. You can scroll through the hats until you find the hat/dlc/skin you own and there you will see that it has no price tag. Click the hat and it will turn into a full suit, altering the appearance of your character to the skin you bought. Now I only saw the shop with online play (which you can still play solo) While on the subject of hats. These devs are either just as old as I am, or they have played every single game out there. The hats are a pop culture wet dream. To see Sir Dan Fortesque as a wearable head brings me back to the 90\\'s. (yes, I know how to spell his last name from memory because I used it as my gamer handle) Some of the hats are sly jokes, while others are a tip of the hat to current trends. Of course there had to be a Dead Pool mask as well. Well played chaps. My last tip. Play the game in online mode, but make your own server, check it as \"Peer to peer\" and just play solo for a while. By doing this, you get the ease of solo mode and you get the shared bank space for all your characters. If you play in solo mode in offline, the stuff you put in your stash will not be transferable. Might as well play solo in a private server and horde your lowbie gear for future characters you make.',\n",

       "  'review': 'After 500+ hours of play time, I finally feel like I can write an honest review from my point of view.  I played Hero Siege years ago before there was seasons, it was a very much different game then.  Since the release of 3.0 (Season 7) I got back into the game and I will say 90% of my hours played are in season 7 alone.  (Dont judge me).\\n\\nI have played hundreds of hours in Grim Dawn, D3, Chaosbane, Eternium etc.  Hero Siege by far is my favorite and shows a lot of promise to getting just better.\\n\\nI play solo or with friends and both I have a lot of fun with.  The game offers many different classes and play styles which you can choose from, the hunt for loot is really satisfying to me. Item drops can be traded with other players in the community either in-game or Discord.  The trading aspect I feel really brings the community together, I have met many great people and made lots of new friends as a result of this.\\n\\nThe game can be played in multiple platforms PC or Mobile, I really like this feature.\\n\\nOne of the major things, I like about the game is that the Devs are fully engaged with the community.  They listen to feedback, and constantly are making updates, balancing changes, and bug/exploit fixes.  I have seen in the past few months alone this dedication from the Dev team (I should remind everyone its two Devs).  Their discord is always updated keeping the community up to date on development plans and future updates.  The game is getting better and better very much alive and growing.\\n\\nIt is so satisfying getting red/green star drops, farming hero levels making your character stronger and stronger is very rewarding I feel.  Endgame pushing leaderboards, through Wormholes feels great. high end Wormholes are a lot of fun, it really provides unique ways to play, dodge projectiles, avoid ground effects, move out of ceiling/sky crashing down effects (rock crumble overhead always gets me).  It is not just blindly speed run around at high end wormholes, proper talents and skill point distribution in hero level tree and merc tree is key to pushing high.  The relic system allows so some really unique ways to play and build your characters.\\n\\nAs I write this review, there is so much content being added to Hero Siege now and near future this is the PERFECT time to jump into this gem of a game and join the great community it has around it!.  See you all in-game Boys/Girls!',\n",

They often have a 4-pack version available.\\n\\nIt's fun with friends (not nearly as fun alone), and it's a nice, affordable game. Runs well on most devices and has a mobile version as well. The developers are also constantly updating (check their changelog) and recently overhauled the game to make it a lot more intuitive and provided a decent amount of quality-of-life changes.\\n\\nThe only real downside is the insane amount of DLCs, but they aren't necessary for the game and are generally cosmetics (skins, pets) or classes (which aren't inherently more OP than the base classes, either).\",\n",

It feels good, and you'll quickly find a class you like to play.\\n\\n\\nThen you get to the higher levels and realize you've been playing a terrible class the entire time and if you want to be able to do endgame, you have to switch because the devs do not balance the classes well at all. Its become quite a meme. You have to grind like a bandsaw to be able to afford upgrades. I'm talking hours and hours worth of just doing this one map (that spawns randomly fyi) and getting about 2k rubies. Ok, how many is that you may ask. Not a lot, considering you may need like 180k to upgrade this piece of satanic gear that you already grinded for 5 hours to get.\\n\\nGame itself is fun. The stupid amounts of boring grinding you have to do to get to endgame is not fun. The grind isn't the problem. I'm not against grinding. Warframe and black desert refugee speaking here. But this grind is freaking BORING. You do the same thing over and over just to be ABLE to do the endgame content. Assuming you also grinded for the gear, assuming you're playing the flavor of the month class, its just such a bother and I really did not expect this game to demand so much time from me to be competitive. Wouldn't recommend the game in its current state. Don't buy the DLC classes either. They are never any good.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Hero Siege never truly left early access, if the devs just committed to copying Diablo 3 and ditching their own ideas from the start, they would have made an awful lot more progress.\\n\\nIt's been a long journey with many ups and downs, I like changes in 3.0, and dislike others, at one point this was an excellent game I was addicted to, now not so much as the formula I really liked has been replace with a low rent Diablo 3 thing, development continually backtracks and is sometimes for the good, but many times just outright breaks the game, or wipes all your characters.\\n\\nMy 4 hours in v3.0 have been boring, difficulty is not ramping up at all, item drops are lame as something drops every 5 seconds removing any significance to picking stuff up, item rarity progression is non-existent, I picked up a legendary before getting to the first town and you'll probs get your first mythic on stage 2, removing any specialness to any of it.\\n\\nGame hit it's peak a long time ago, and it's on a downhill path copying everything D3 dose, but worse.\\n\\nWorth a try for sure, as it will improve over time, then backtrack to early access again when a new chunk of Diablo 3 design is copied in.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'EDIT: Big Update came out, currently testing it, will edit my review as soon as I understand mechanics fully + how it matters in endgame. \\n\\n\\nI would´ve recommended this game, but there are some serious issues that can´t and won´t be fixed by the devs. \\nBut before I list my [u]Positive and Negative Aspects of the game[/u], let´s just find out what Hero Siege is about\\n\\n\\n[h1]What is Hero Siege?[/h1]\\n\\nHero Siege is a Top-down Diablo-like RPG Hack and Slash with some kind of Rogue-like elements in it.\\nThere are a total of 17 Classes of which 8 are free to choose from, the other 9 classes are locked behind a paywall.\\nYou start your journey as a level 1 Character and play through 6 Acts, each Act has 4 \"normal\" stages with the 5th being the Boss Stage that houses the Act-Boss. \\nTo reach the next stage you have to kill a certain amount of enemies, in order to spawn a stage Boss which you have to defeat to further progress. \\nEach stage is randomly generated. After completing Act 6 you unlock the next difficulty, there are a total of 4 difficulties starting with \"Normal\", \"Nightmare\", \"Hell\" and \"Inferno\".\\n\\nDuring your journey you will gather:\\n[list]\\n[*]EXP/Levels/Talent Points [spoiler]Level 100 is the maximum so you have 100 Talent Points to level up your favorite Skills, each capping at 30 Talent Points[/spoiler]\\n[*]Gold [spoiler]used for buying Keys to open Chests/Wormholes[/spoiler]\\n[*]Equipment with diverse rarity-levels [spoiler]\"Normal\", \"Rare\", \"Legendary\", \"Mythic\", \"Satanic\" and \"Satanic-Set\" and \"Angelic\") [u]NOTE:[/u] Satanic and Satanic-Set, as well as Angelic only drop in difficulty \"Hell\" and \"Inferno\"[/spoiler]\\n[*]Rubies [spoiler]used to buy ingame cosmetics and Satanic Items from other players, rubies are also used to level up your Satanic Items[/spoiler]\\n[*]Relics [spoiler]Buff-Items that make you stronger, giving you certain procc-chances or even enable you to fly, you can have a maximum of 31 of these - upon death you will lose every single one of your acquired relics but they can be found again[/spoiler]\\n[/list]\\n\\nBut why play this game, what´s the endgame? Your goal in this game is to reach Character Level 100 and unlock \"Inferno\" Difficulty. After hitting Character Level 100 you gain Paragon-like Levels that increase your choice of Stats by the factor +1%.\\nThe ultimative challenge in this game are the \"Wormholes\" Portals that can be opend via a key that can be bought from NPCs with Gold. There are Leaderboards for how far every Class made progress in Wormholes, Solo, Duo, Trio and Squad Ranking.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Positive Aspects[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]It´s Hack and Slash and the rogue-like elements make this game really fun to play\\n[*]The Game is easy to understand\\n[*]Getting  to Level 100 is easy\\n[*]Content is fairly easy until lategame, playing in \"Inferno\" Difficulty is at first very challenging\\n[*]The In-Game Community is nice to newbies\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]Negative Aspects[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*][u]This game has little to no cheat/dupe protection[/u], despite the fact that the devs are proud of their \"cheat detect system\" which is totally not working well enough\\n[*]There are quite a lot of Bug-abuser even in high Wormhole Rankings, Players literally Screenshot suspicious players and their gear and post it on their Discord to force actions from Admins (It´s a fu**ing drop of water on a hot stone)\\n[*]The amount of Cheaters/Bug-abuser and the likes is astonishingly high, leaving honest players that grind like it´s intended looking like dumb fools wasting their time\\n[*]Skills don´t get explained too much or how they scale\\n[*]Not every Class has a Satanic-Set and even if so, the perks these Set give emphasize my statement that the Devs actually don`t have a clue how their game/the classes are played\\n[*]Some Classes are so weak, they are Relic-dependent to even work decently\\n[*]You will die very often without being able to comprehend what happened, as you won´t see Projectiles because your screen is filled with 20310045 visual effects of abilities\\n[*]Some Enemy Abilities are not telegraphed at all, no cast-animation it´s just instantly there and their ability kills you no matter what (talking about Thunderstorm mobs especially)\\n[*]Items have Quality rating ranging from 60%-100% - this value is generated on each drop [u]RANDOMLY[/u] so even if you get a good Item, you have to pray to rngeesus that it´s actually usable\\n[*]You can be so unlucky in this game that you farm 4 hours straight without getting a Single Satanic drop\\n[*]Satanic Items that are worthy to level up, require Rubies to do so. [b]The total costs to max level just one[/b] Satanic Item are [u][b]175.000 rubies[/u][/b]\\n[*]Farming rubies is essential, there is literally only one spot to farm these and the devs even nerf this location which BAFFLES me - you already have to put in hours on end to get the items you want and now you need even more hours of boring grinding\\n[*]This farming spot is a special Dungeon that has a spawn-chance of roughly 20-25%, but let me tell you I had sessions where this dungeon didn´t appear for 20+ resets of the map (location of the dungeon is always random on top of that) and you will get around 2000 rubies with the coming nerfs - do the math yourself how many hours you need to grind\\n[*]Enemies have certain colors to distinguish what abilities you will confront BUT Thunderstorm (arguably the most broken Ability) shares the same blue color as mobs with the Ability to freeze you\\n[*][u]Magic Find[/u] in this game is more than odd, as the generated Stage you enter contains a [b]seed[/b] [u]which determines weather or not you get a Satanic Item or not[/u] (There is a threshhold mechanic that´s basically unconfirmed, but just let me tell you this amount is only achievable with the best of the best gear)\\n[*]The [u]fond[/u] in this game is the worst I´ve ever seen. It´s so bad that my Minion that followed me, which is named \"Chickenboi\" could be read as \"Ohiokenboi\" \\n[*]There have been several instances so far that whole seasons were reset, because a couple of elitist gamers abused certain mechanics (They even reset the current Season Wormhole-ranking because of said players and were about to reset EVERYTHING, it only didnt happen because players voted against this decision)\\n[*]The Devs certainly don\\'t understand their own game and at this point it´s even a meme in the community\\n[*]Balancing of classes is not given, there are [u]multiple pay-to-play[/u] classes that seriously see no play at all because they are basically useless (This gets confirmed by looking at the wormhole ranking)\\n[*]Talents and Abilities are really boring and leave much to be desired\\n[*]In order to get Items, you literally have to use their Discord. The In-game Trade-chat is a joke and your jaw will drop, how expensive Items are in this game\\n[*]Mana cost of some Classes make no sense at all, it`s so bad that some Classes can only be played with extremely good gear or else they are rendered absolutely useless\\n[*]There usually is a flavor of the season Class and it´s disgustingly broken compared to the other Classes\\n[*]You won`t see shit in this game because all the proccs, abilities etc. fill up the screen so much, that you easily lose sight of yourself and anything at all (there are newly added Options to hide Projectiles that Groupmembers emit, but it doesn\\'t help at all so my point stands)\\n[*]Wormhole (Endgame-Content Nephalem-like like in Diablo3) has no real purpose besides having the bigger E-peen. [u]Ruby drops from Wormhole bosses give you around 250-500 Rubies[/u], it doesn´t increase significantly and therefore feels not rewarding at all\\n[/list]',\n",

       "  'review': \"Been a fan of the game for years - first discovered it on mobile when it was just a hack&slash\\nI was stoked to see all the changes to it after a long time not playing it, with multiplayer and all\\nThe game is incredibly fun, especially with friends to play it with...\\n... [b][u]BUT[/u][/b]\\nThe absolute amount of bugs that we've encountered kind of counter-measured the fun itself, to the point we got kind of tired of the whole thing and looked for other similar games.\\nSome examples are: \\nwhen you pass a level or get in or out from a dungeon or anything similar, your collected buffs will not be visible on you, and they will otherwise be on your friend -- \\nsometimes when entering dungeon (even boss rooms) one player doesn't see any mob, while the other sees all of them standing idle, also that sometimes prevents the reward from killing the boss even if the fight happened -- \\nboss of a zone randomly triggers after one of the players leaves the area before the other --\\na crazy amount of graphic bugs, which are obviously not as important as gameplay issues, but it's nice to have a clean and tidy game imho\\n\\nTL;DR: recommended? Yes, [b]if[/b] it gets some fixes to the current flaws. I'm sure i'm not the only one who's seen weird bugs and flaws\",\n",

Meaning any new players literally good luck. Older players hate it cause they cant get more gear but they have decent gear to grind inferno's wormholes ect. If you buy it now you will have to play way way longer just to get to the grinding part they are on. Aka want to play 100+ hrs for someone elses 15hrs then play this. Want a fair fun grinding but rewarding game? well pray that the developers fix the drop rates. Btw I played Runescape (oldschool version) maxed as an ironman. (all 99s and most of the decent gear drops minus raids lol) and this is on that level of grind.. Just not as rewarding because first you grind get a nice satanic finally! turns out its only good for now then you need the better % ones each time again grind again for 5+hours (if lucky) and get another satanic. (if lucky) its of your class (if lucky) its better then your other one (if not.. well go back to grinding lmao..) Literally dont mind the grind part just mind the 5hrs for a drop clearing maps non stop for hours without a drop just to get one and its trash.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"For 1.99$ when on sales this game is quite enjoyable and you will have a great return of fun for the small amount of money you spend. Most classes are the same with different spell skins with little tweaks. 7.99$ is the price of the game without sales.\\nThe whole game package can cost you 120$, a bunch of classes are unlockable for 5-8$ each which is the price of the game in itself, for a total of 55$. Some of those classes are much more powerful than the base one, when it come to paying special aesthetic you can justify micro-transaction, for classes that bring more powerful abilities than other, is it not.\\nThis game is ripping off multiple attribute of games and there is a big doubt about it's copyrights rights. Zelda, WoW, D3, etc writing font, items, slightly modified spell icons etc. Greed at it's finest.\\n\\nImportant note, most classes end up with auto attack build.\\n\\nDifficulties are all over the place, nothing is linear. You will finish normal within the level bracket but once you hit Nightmare you will be in zones of level 50 while being level 100. Hell increase the monster levels above level 100. Be ready to get one shot  at any difficulties. Yes even on the first summoned boss on normal, if you are unlucky, you will spawn a boss that will one shot you.\\n\\nFarming comes in 2 flavors, spamming maps or wormhole, basicly greater Rifts. Let's talk about that.\\nSatanic, aka D3 legendaries style items that are very rare, you may only drop one every 4 hours farming the same map every 2 minutes. They are increasing the drop rate, so expect those loots to be even more rare.\\nWormholes are only available in Inferno difficulty, mobs starts level 250 and will one shot you with any attack. You will need amazing items to even start Inferno and farming wormholes. Even with 3-4 Satanic of your class you won't be able to start Inferno and enjoy it.\\nInferno difficulty is also being increased.\\n\\nHero levels, they only add 1% of a chosen stats and the first level takes longer than leveling from 1 to 100.\\n\\nAnd remember to keep your rubies, because the game will not tell you that they are useful until you hit level 100 and get your first satanic items after hours of farming.\\n\\nRubies are hard to get, a single satanic upgrade cost 10k and will now cost 15k as they are increasing it. You will roughly make 10k rubies per 1h - 1h30 if you are going fast. Some items are selling for more than 100k rubies.\\n\\nAfter 50 hours which maybe 15h is AFK, I cannot recommend you to take this game seriously as there is better out there. I ultimately played it when I was under substance making it better and funnier.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Cool and simple mix of twin stick shooter/ARPG. Pixel graphics, the music is very reminiscent of Diablo and it's one the reasons I personally keep coming back to it, the gameplay is a sort of Smash TV (kill everything on the area). Upon killing everything (filling a Boss Meter) a random Boss will show up (à la Binding of Isaac) and once you kill it you may proceed to the next area. \\n\\nYou travel through waypoints, some areas may spawn small rooms with extra loot/bosses and every few areas there's a town with quests and NPCs, but every area is accessible once you kill the area boss.\\n\\nLots of classes, lots of loot and different ways to play. Most classes have about 10 talents (or skills if you will). You earn points by leveling up although gear and relics can also improve your stats and skills. Relics stay with you until death.\\n\\nFeatures several difficulty modes and a Hardcore mode, encouraging replayability.\\nIt's just fun, but features EXCESSIVE DLC (both classes and skins, the former really paywall away almost half of the game, while the latter is just cosmetic bollocks) in my opinion, which is my main and only real gripe with the game. \\n\\nIf it didn't look so greedy, this game would be near perfect for both the casual crowd and the dedicated fanbase. The only real reason I kind of understand the heaps of DLC is the fact the game has been very actively supported throughout the years. Expanding and building upon itself in a mostly positive way, but still the prices are real steep and they quickly add up if you are the kind of person that just HAS TO HAVE every piece of content.\\n\\nThese last points make my thumb go sideways, not all the way down, but I still talk of the game in an overall positive light to my friends whenever they ask WTF am I playing.\\n\\nIt's been discounted several times and if you're looking for an uncompromising twin stick shooter with RPG elements, I recommend you pick it up with a couple friends (party can support up to 4 players) and take it for a spin.\",\n",

Discounted all the DLC i purchased as in they don't show up anymore. Got rid of the merchants in levels. What where they thinking?!. But it used to be a good game.

Got my viking character to level 150 and this was basically the game I played all the time. But as soon as the developers updated it in 2018 it hasn't been the same. For every update you have to basically start over. They recently updated the game and the style, which I just don't like. I am sick of getting up to the highest level and then start over. All talents and new attacks changes whenever a new update comes. \\n\\nSo nothing quite good anymore in this game. I hate to say it but I won't play it anymore.\",\n",

The cheap price of the game is a big plus, but is worth noting that the game has classes you can't play unless if you buy their DLC. The base classes are not worse than the DLC classes and the game is not p2w.\\n\\nThe game has a very small community and it's a nice environment on the game's discord for the most part. Be careful to follow the rules as first time offenses often lead to bans depending on who sees it and when. Overall the community is very nice and I appreciate all the hard work the mods do.\\n\\nIn the current season of the game, there has been some dupe exploits and many people are dissuaded from competing, but as a newcomer you will mostly just be trying to learn this first season anyways.\\n\\nOverall, for the price, the game is very good. Updates are plentiful and the devs try to balance the game every week by small iterations on the weaker classes.\\n\\nI rate it 8/10, definitely worth trying if you are an ARPG fan.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'After a bunch of hours, i think i understand this game a bit. It\\'s overall a good game, and because i like grinding it gave me some fun. There is a small problem tho, and i haven\\'t read it in the reviews under this game yet: the seasonal sistem. Let\\'s make it simple to explain: after 3 months all you have done became useless and you need to start again from 0. Your \"seasonal\" pg became normal and you lose all your gems, so it\\'s a real reset. Now, a grinding game where you spend 200 hours in 3 months JUST to appear in the leaderboard is something that i cannot understand, and i have played tons of games. Something like this is just pointless. (And even if you want to play in normal, you would be alone with 5 people, 1 server and yourself.) Now, for some people with a big, fat ego that can be fun and all, but for a player like me that just want to farm, reach the max possibilities of all the classes and ejoy the game with other people, this is just a mess.\\n\\n\\nSo, would i reccomend this game? If you like this sistem sure, but otherwise don\\'t buy this game.',\n",

Trading is basically just a channel with lots of item screenshots, no prices, you then message the seller and offer a price. (as a new player this is a nightmare and gets you scammed 9 our of 10 times, which mods are fine with and partake in even)\\n\\n*  There\\'s no real \"endgame\" other than leaderboards within the season (and the only reason to play season is 1 cosmetic reward at the end if you finish in the top 50 of your class)\\n\\n* Exploits.. from item duping to currency generation (which are used in trading) it has everything and devs aren\\'t doing much to stop that so it screws with the leaderboards heavily\\n\\n* Massive bugs and performance issues with the client and apparently with their servers too. Items getting lost, ban false positives daily (they have a discord channel for that which doesn\\'t help because they think their system is flawless), random fps drops and performance issues when you play for a longer time (doesn\\'t seem to be a memory leak in the client but in their instance code perhaps)\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t buy this game, much less any of the overpriced DLCs today, nor should you, it\\'s going nowhere.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Well I guess there's a reason for this game's rating to drop drastically since last patch. :) Game has 4 difficulties - normal, nightmare, hell and inferno. In order to be able to play (not get one-shot by anything or do any damage at all) on inferno you need satanic rarity items which you obviously must farm on hell. The droprate of those is so low that you can farm 14+ hours with 1200% magic find and still not get a single piece. I got to hell in like 3 hours and been farming since and got total of 3 satanic items (so around 35 hours of farming) and only one of them is useful. So if you like doing the same repetitive grind over and over again all day for days you might like this game, if you want a game that doesn't make you grind for weeks before even reaching endgame I wouldn't recommend you this one.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The existence of this game is an inevitability. It\\'s practically a monument to what the genre has become... and it\\'s horrible.\\n\\nBefore the review: a history lesson.\\n\\nRogue. Classic game about exploring dungeons and managing the items collected as resources, incidentally permanent death. The game was old, so of course death was permanent. This game has inspired many games. Hack/Nethack, Moria/Angband, ToME, etc.\\n\\nFrom here we get Diablo. Originally criticized for being a real-time Rogue-like, as though doing such a thing was \"against the rules,\" but the end result was good. Dark atmosphere, magical items, permanent character modification through shrines and books, resource management, etc. It nails the Rogue theme while being a real-time game instead of turn based. It\\'s funny comparing the response to that game\\'s release when nowadays \"Rogue-like\" has nothing to do with Rogue. Even games like Diablo are considered their own genre...\\n\\nBut that\\'s because people are taking about Diablo 2. Diablo 2 is the game which primarily defines the \"Diablo genre.\" Unlike Diablo 1, Diablo 2 focuses more on loot treadmills and unique character class features. The game is designed entirely around the core principle of \"character advancement.\" Eventually the game developed a ladder system, used by Diablo 3, and used by Path of Exile for their mini-expansion release schedule. The idea was to get people to play forever by experiencing progression over and over.\\n\\nDiablo 3 takes this one step further by completely distancing itself from what made the first game good, and instead redefines itself as an action game instead of a horror, resource-management game. While Diablo 3 does have interesting decisions you can make to make your character interesting and unique, the designers later decided to let go of this feature of the game that still existed in Diablo 2. Instead it pretends to give you this feature, while actually forcing you to use only the \"item sets\" that exist if you want to \"compete\" at the same level as other players. I could write a book about this topic, but we\\'re talking about Hero Siege here.\\n\\nTo finally review Hero Siege, it would be like if you took Diablo 3, and continued the trend of homogeneity and simplicity one step further. Items and classes are so streamlined that basically all you do is equip items with bigger numbers, and level up your health and damage. It goes on forever.\\n\\nYou don\\'t get to decide what systems you utilize to do damage, or be defensive. At least even Diablo 3 got a dodge roll in the console port. Games like Path of Exile and Grim Dawn, which are more keen to remain similar to Diablo 2 have this complex system based on the concept of \"damage trinities.\" Fire Emblem is known for using this method to force the player to make tactical decisions instead of brute forcing your units. Certain types of strategies are weaker and stronger against other encounters. Finding ways to design your character to have as many strengths as possible and as few weakness as possible is what makes a game like Path of Exile and Grim Dawn good. Strip all of those features out and you get Hero Siege.\\n\\nThis game is mindless and bad. I would not pay more than $1 for this.\\n\\nIf this game presented itself as a bullet hell game like Enter the Gungeon this review might be different. However, unfortunately it utilizes the same psychological trap of loot treadmills and false agency to convince you that the bland random generation and chaotic gameplay is unique and rewarding.\\n\\nDon\\'t play this game.',\n",

All around a super fun bullet hell rpg with a touch of rouge like (not hardcore) thats easy to get into and tough to master. havent reached much of the endgame (lvl 72 Redneck) but not too grindy as ive seen so far. welcoming community and easy lobby creating system for friends or randoms. why not give it a try.\\n\\nits cheap, fun, and addicting \\n\\nI recommend and hope this has been helpful.\\n\\n|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|\\n...../ )\\n.....' /\\n---' (_____\\n.........

       "  'review': 'Had this game from a few years ago, it\\'s definitely a lot better looking but getting the Complete Bundle deal is literally it looking you dead in the eye and saying \"Pay for all of me like I was a standard Triple A game.\" Personally, I liked it, but $60+ is an amazingly arrogant proposition. If they were a fraction of what they are now, say, $2-3 I\\'d probably be saying \"Eh, might as well.\" But no. It\\'s a little over $60 for the complete bundle with all the DLC. Who the fuck else knows about how much a triple A title costs? Y\\'know, Call of Duty, Halo, the Witcher, GTA, any modern triple A title really. FUCKING. 60. DOLLARS.\\n\\nIf the DLC stayed as cheap as they were way back when the game wasn\\'t a total shitshow, that entire first paragraph wouldn\\'t even be a thought in my mind. I\\'d have bought it without a second thought in all honesty,\\n\\nThen checked out all of the stuff about the devs allowing a notorious hacker in their community to basically run around doing god knows what fucking up god knows who\\'s game and even when they DID ban him, ONE OF THEM UNBANNED HIM AND FUCKING GOT RID OF THE MODS WHO DID IT.\\n\\nThat alone makes me lose trust in this, don\\'t give them your money. A shitty dev is a shitty dev, no matter what kind of bs they try to spout about how their team is full of \"saints\" and the game is \"flawless\".',\n",

       "  'review': \"Well, one thing's for sure, you can't trust Steam review scores. Very good, is the new mediocre, and this game is mediocre at best.\\n\\nIt's a clunky, poorly designed, poorly supported, unimaginative, action hack and slash clone.\\n\\nParts the game seems to be under construction or something and is unavailable. Multiple tabs does nothing. Very little information on anything, tool tips almost non existent. The wiki is a complete mess. No one is nursing this game in any substantial way in any sphere of it's existence.\\n\\nAnd for all this, the developer has the audacity to put a lot of the player characters behind a paywall. Unbelievable.\\n\\nSo do I regret buying this game? Nah, because I paid 2 bucks for it. But my message to you is, skip it anyway. There's a million games in this vein that are much better made, and to be frank this title simply doesn't deserve any money at all.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Back a few months ago, I would have given this game a big thumb up and said \"go, buy it, it\\'s a no brainer, you won\\'t regret it\". But that was then.\\n\\nThe latest big patch changed lots of things, and from what I understand, pretty much everything was nerfed. But I can\\'t be sure, because ALL my characters are now naked. All equipment gone, nothing left in the stash. Only the gold remains.\\n\\nApparently, \"none of the old equipments are compatible with the new system, so they have been wiped\". I now have a lvl 100 Amazon (which was 88 before the patch, insta bonus XP when I loaded her) with absolutely no gear whatsoever. Not even a basic armor, no javelin, no nothing. In a way I\\'m lucky I hadn\\'t played THAT much, it\\'s only 30+ hours of item farming that are now lost. Some lost hundreds of hours worth of items.\\n\\nIf I want to keep playing that character, or any other for the matter, I\\'ll have to go naked back in first level, first difficulty, to punch enemies in the face until one finally drop a javelin so I can start using my skills.\\n\\nBasically, that\\'s a \"no, thanks\". Except that I\\'d rather replace \"thanks\" by some expletive.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t mind that sort of things, go ahead, buy the game, it\\'s fun. If you\\'d rather not lose every single item ever when a big updates lands, then you\\'re better off giving this game a wide berth.\\n\\nEDIT : I noticed that the merchant can now generate random legendary gear for gold, and I had lots of gold. So I kept spawning completely random gear until I got re-equiped. 2 hours and 1.9 million gold later, my Amazon has gear in every slot, but stat-wise it\\'s really not that great (high stats for sure, but not always stats I\\'d want to use), same thing for my Marksman. Both of them needed a lot of tries to get ONE weapon they could use.\\n\\nBack in the days, it was a bit odd, but you could equip any weapon. A Marksman would still shoot arrows or an Amazon throw a javelin, even if they had equipped a sword. I see why that was changed, but it means anything like the random gear generator has massively more chances to spawn a useless weapon.\\n\\nAnd that was confirmed when I tried to re-equip my Shaman. While I had found no end of magic weapons on Amazon or Marksman, it took me well over 1.4 million gold to get ONE magic weapon, and it was 2 levels too high. And because my characters are at different levels, I can\\'t even have them trade weapon, they couldn\\'t use them. They could have had, if I had started with the lowest level one, better use a sub-level weapon than no weapon at all... But I started with the strongest.\\n\\nAs of today, my Shaman still can\\'t equip a weapon, my Necromancer is still naked, and I\\'m down to roughly 700 000 gold, from the 2.6 millions I had initially. My interest for the game evaporated faster than my gold, though. 2 hours spawning random weapons hopelessly bring boredom really fast. Still gave a look at the skills themselves and whatnot.\\n\\nCharacter level cap is now lower than before. Skills cap lower too. Delays to recast skills are longer (that, or my previous gear removed much of it while the random crap I got doesn\\'t). Used to place several turrets at the same time with the Marksman, now with the delays I can\\'t. And some equipment has stats that are not self-explanatory at all, like \"Cdr\". What the heck is \"Cdr\" ? My bet is on \"CoolDown Reduction\", but could be anything else, as there is no info anywhere.\\n\\nThe game used to be good, now it is, at best, generic AF.\\n\\nAnd if you buy it for coop online to play with friends, well... Lots of people are reporting permanent bans when they tried to play online for the first time and whatnot. Maybe they were cheaters, but people with like 10 minutes game time get banned too.\\n\\nSeriously, stay away from that piece of junk.',\n",

It's a unique kind of rpg rogue-lite that you should check out if....if your prepared for none of the mechanics to stay the same and the entire game to potentially switch up systems. I'm not sure if the developers are done playing with mechanics and are now just updating what they feel is a complete game, but for years did this game get flipped and tossed and reworked constantly. The amount of times i reinstalled this game and saw all my progress erased and characters deleted was in the dozens. There were many times where i would feel like i was playing a different game because they had scraped the old systems. some systems I enjoyed. Back when this game just came out on mobile it was so much fun. I'ts still fun now but its lost some charm and atmosphere due to i'ts unsteady development.\",\n",

This one sided stance is absurd and I don\\'t see anything that guarantees quality or why they are so confident. Again, the game itself seems pretty fun and it might be that I am over thinking it, but with the amount of money for DLC and expansions and this \"we won\\'t listen to you or fix any issues regarding bans\" makes me feel putting any amount of money into this risky, especially since bans are automatic and done by computer. My recommendation is if you buy this and play it (I will play it some more myself) I would hold off actually putting money or any monetary investment into it unless you are absolutely confident you want to do so and will not get some sort of ban. This just feels pretty risky, I personally wouldn\\'t do anything like cheating, but the mere fact that they leave it all to a machine and say \"We will never overturn this and just talking about it is grounds for banning\" is like...yeah.

Bought the three DLC’s, don’t feel like I’m being gouged by buying them. It’s no more pay to play than diablo 3.\\nThe reason for the thumbs down is the online play, when you host a game you take extensive damage but the guest takes very little. This ruins the online play, hosting you become frustrated by constantly dying and for the guest it’s pretty boring because there’s no challenge or risk. I googled the issue and it dates back a few years. My demonspawn is invulnerable when I’m a guest with manashield up but no mana goes down. It’s just frustrating to think this has been an issue for so long. My review will change as soon as it’s fixed.\\nI’d recommend this for anyone wanting to play offline. \\nThe issues have been fixed for some time now and the game has gone through two major patches, each one improving and changing the gameplay. I've played  an obscene amount of this game, I recommend it highly\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Great and addicting game.\\n\\nAt first, it looks like one of those twin stick shooters, but after a while you notice it's a full fledged action RPG with quite a lot of stuff to do. The game will keep you busy for hours, with all the loot you can collect, the grinding you have to make and all the levels yu have to beat. There are 6 acts (each with multiple levels), 6 difficulty levels, 15 very different classes and lots of bosses, each with it's own attack pattern.\\n\\nThe graphics are simple, but effective. Sprites aren't very detailed, but are varied, and the game ha some neat special effects. Each skill looks completely different than the others, same for the enemies' attacks. There's some neat lighning effects too.\\n\\nThe sound department doesn't leave a lot to be desired. Sound effects are sharp and varied, each character has some lines of dialogue and the musics help sety the horror tone of the game. There are no memorable songs in here, but the soundtrack does it job.\\n\\nI've seen people complaininbg about the DLC, but I honestly liked it. They are cheap and add enough content to be really worth the price. Plus, this game is being worked on since 2014, and always get new content and new patches! The game changed a lot since release, feels even more complete (there are even optional quests that grants you interesting rewards).\\n\\nOh, and this game even has local coop, a feature that is getting more and more rare on PC. You can also play online, but I never tested it.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. Runs great even on a toaster (I play it on a crappy underclocked Celeron) and can keep you busy for hundreds of hours. ^^\",\n",

       "  'review': 'From a player who used to grind this game super hard, its a great game. The early game turns you away and the game feels somewhat unplayable without the dlcs. Lategame and wormholes and grinding that whole loop is a fun experience, but having to grind to max level is one of the most boring tasks imaginable. Overall the graphics are enjoyable and I do hope that they find a way for old players to enjoy the game, as I want to grind and play but finding the will to grind to max level again each season isnt fun, it turns into people asking for boosts constantly. Good game though. I would ONLY recommend this to people if they are willing to sink a good 5-10 hours of their life into a very boring experience, only then does the game become competitive and fun. (also relics need a buff, there are about 10 good ones and the rest are booty)',\n",

Game's super niche even more so than what you expect. Stat system isn't intuitive to me and you lose all you good stuff on death which isn't really a problem til you get one shotted out of nowhere. Didn't refund the game immediately because it's cheap and well it's an indie dev so why be a diek to them when it's clearly a passion project for their niche. If you Like minmaxing and random loot drop and micro managing whilst being in a semi bullet hell / shoot em up then this is probs a game where you ignore the flaws and spend months on.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Pleasantly surprised by this title. Rogue-lites are pretty hit-or-miss for me. Downloaded this on a whim, played for 30 minutes and immediately bought the base game and 30 min later some DLC because I got the game for so cheap and wanted more classes to try out. This game came out in 2014 and the devs are still adding content (free + paid) with a big 3.0 update coming soon that improves performance, minions, skill trees, 360 degree attack (instead of previous 4 direction) and a ton more. Worth every penny.\\n\\nUPDATE\\nSo no point in playing until 3.0 is released since they are changing so much of the core game every bit of progress you make will be wiped. Would be nice if they actually told you that before spending time playing.',\n",

This is a huge plus, but the game can get a bit boring/stale after many continuous hours of play. At least it did in my case.\\nI personally got the most enjoyment out of this in short, one to two hour sessions.\\n\\n7/10, it is a decent game that I still find myself playing every so often, even though I've owned it for close to 6 years now.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought the 4-pack of this game years ago during a Steam sale, planning to gift the spares to some friends and try it out together; and a few nights ago, I finally did so. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the experience that followed. This game has a very poor introduction for new players, especially in a multiplayer context. There are a lot of complex, interacting systems in building and developing your character that are poorly explained and difficult to try to figure out without holding up your teammates. You don't want to stop every five minutes to try to figure out whether the new boots you just found that give +45 stamina and +38 strength are better or worse than your old ones that give +48 armor, +29 energy, and +31 speed. I don't need an extensive tutorial, but there's a huge amount of information that seems to be impossible to figure out without checking a guide or wiki, and if you're going blind you're pretty much just guessing on where's the best place to put your skill points. Even from choosing your class at the very beginning, the game doesn't explain anything about the relevant differences in their playstyles, only mentioning one trivial detail about each. And the customization and microtransaction options that have accumulated in the game since its release feel like a bloated mess when you see them all at once coming in new to the game. \\n\\nEven once you get past all of that, the actual gameplay is rather monotonous and not all that much fun. There's fast-paced action, but it's too chaotic to even tell what's going on or how effective you're being half the time, and most of the enemy types feel pretty similar to one another. Bosses look intimidating, but frequently die comically quickly. Game balance is all over the place, with wild swings in power between different classes, builds, equipment drops, relics, etc. There's theoretically a huge amount of variety and customization potential in the game, but somehow none of it feels like it has any real weight, and it all just kind of feels pointless. Of course, this is all just my own opinion; but me and my three friends played through the first two acts over the course of about 4 hours, and afterwards none of us felt much desire to continue playing through the rest of the game. We didn't have a terrible time, for what it was; but I ended up wishing we'd spent our time on something else instead. So if you want a co-op hack-and-slash experience, I suggest looking elsewhere.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I played this game back in its earliest stages on the Google Playstore. Back then, there were 3 or 4 classes and about 120 stages. It was like Binding of Issac in that when you died, you started over completely. \\n\\nI got rid of it after awhile, not for any malice, but due to phone memory (my phone was pretty shitty). Time passed and it added a VERY irksome mechanic of ranged immunity, which kind of cuts out the point of the marksman class (low damage, low-moderate speed, high range). On top of that was a RNG imbalance which made many many enemies have this ranged immunity. I uninstalled due to this\\n\\nMore time passed and it went to the paid model. However, I had it while it was still F2P, so I downloaded it again. It added the zombie hands popping out of the ground and more classes. Balanced out a bit, but it ceased to be that same game from the beginning, adding in saves and different weapons, changing the entire skill tree, and trying to be a RPG game not unlike diablo. Adding in sidequests and things like that\\n\\nThen a long time passed and it came here. I decided to buy because it was on sale and I wanted to see yet again how it changed...........\\n\\n..........It's a huge testament to watching a game decline in quality until it's unplayable. Seriously, of a 120 strong library of games (not a single F2P game) this is probably THE most boring game I have in my Steam Library. There's nothing more boring than killing enemies to fill up a bar insanely slow only to fight a boss that is marginally harder than the enemies you've been fighting. The sounds are jagged, no music, most quests are pretty much defeat, collect or defeat and collect. The skills are drab, equipment isn't really all that important, automatic health regeneration deeply undermines any modicum of difficulty you encounter. Speaking of which, any difficulty comes from the fact that you take a bunch of hits to kill an enemy, there's a lot of them, and you HAVE to fight them to fill that bar to end the level. \\n\\nThe worst thing about this used-to-be-amazing game is that every level is a GRIND. You're literally just killing enemy after enemy after enemy so you can finally take on the boss to end the level. It's filler to pad out game time. It's BORING. The levels take a long-ass time to complete. You're not grinding for equipment or experience. You're grinding to beat the level. It's bad.\\n\\nOn record, I have 1 hour. However, I played this game twice when I went to the laundromat and put 5 hours into it offline. After 6 hours of trying to convince myself that this game will get better, I can't take it anymore. This is 6 hours I could've put into a game that's actually GOOD. \\n\\nI just can't anymore. Screw this game\",\n",

I have to give this game a thumbs down. Not being able to fire character skills diagonally completely turned me off.  \\n\\nPros:\\nThe art style and skill effects feel well done. \\nLocal multiplayer aka coach coop\\n\\nCons:\\nIt says full controller support but I played this on controller and could not fire my skills diagonally. That makes this game a complete joke for the time of game that it is. \\nPaid DLC classes... if you want more than 5 or 6 options\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'After reading a bunch of reviews made by others, I decided to make my own.\\n\\nThis game has its pros and cons, but my overall experience has been very good, especially considering the price tag of the main game. Buying all the DLCs may be a bit heavy on your wallet but the game is definitely not \"pay to play\" or anything like that. As the developers have said, they need to pay their salaries, bills and food too. I don\\'t see a problem in charging for extra content, since there definitely are people who are willing to support the devs for some extra content. They\\'re also updating the game constantly, still after several years.\\n\\nThe core mechanics and overall game experience are great and the concept is well thought out. This game will definitely be hours of fun for anyone who\\'s considering buying it. But I have to say that it does get very frustrating trying to farm items that are decent enough to use. To progress past Wormhole level 1, you have to play for a really long time (after 20-30 hours of farming I still don\\'t have good enough gear, and I\\'ve only managed to find 2 Satanic items, which are essential for further progress). This is especially a problem in Single Player, as you can still trade items with other players in Multiplayer. I\\'m sure I\\'d have quite decent gear already if I played in MP, but since I don\\'t, I have to play the same maps over and over again and hope that I can find a single good item at some point. It feels very unrewarding trying to grind.\\n\\nEither way, if you don\\'t mind grinding or you\\'re planning to play on Multiplayer (which you probably should), this game is definitely something to consider buying.',\n",

       "  'review': 'It hurts me so much I have to give thumb down to this game (at current stage).\\nI have ~230hrs on the clock with this piece, so I put a lot of time and effort into it. However even though I was hoping for some modifications of the game mechanics, it stays the same and it f***ing frustrates me.\\n\\nSo, let\\'s start with pros :\\n- graphics, I like the retro style\\n- not HW demanding\\n- good playability on both keyboard and gamepad\\n- local multiplayer\\n- internet multiplayer (just the possibility, quality of your coplayers...vary)\\n- good for kill\\'em\\'all!!! mood\\n\\nCons :\\nNote : when reading the below, remember, there is no possibility to return to a save if you die. In case of death you loose your relics and go from the beginning. You keep only your exp, money and your equipment. There is no \"I\\'ll save it before I go fight this boss and reload if I fail.\"\\nNote 2 : relics are the key in the game. Talents & hero level - that\\'s without discussion important, but relics are the key difference in your survival especially on higher difficulties.\\n- multiplayer heroes are leveled separately from your singleplayer game, ugh.\\n- the game is unbalanced vol 1. Heavily. Lower difficulties are really walk in the park. However on higher difficulties you die and you don\\'t even know how. Singlehit kill is no exception, which is kinda frustrating, because if an enemy teleports to you, has range resistance, is reflecting your bullets and as a bonus is electrified...you are f***ed. Your survival is too much a question of luck and not your skill/grinded equipment.\\n- the game is unbalanced vol 2. I don\\'t know what they are constantly changing with the heroes, but they succesfully nerfed my 150 lvl heroes. Like srsly - my shaman is the highest level, has a VERY good equipment and needs two hits to destroy wooden boxes? Also the skills were impacted and are nowhere near to what I remember.\\n- you have to REMEMBER how some of the (mini)bosses are working or you are dead, because one mistake easily means death and the game gives you no hint. Not cool.\\n- you have to REMEMBER how the relics are working, because you have limited amount you can carry, you cannot drop them after you pick it up and some of the relics are s**t. Partially intentionally - like flies in jar, and partially just because nobody is probably reviewing whether existing relics still makes sense - these are i.e. all the relics adding just few points to some of your skills.\\n- many relics have [Secret] ability. You have to know or you have to search wiki. F**k that sick mechanis as well. It\\'s only annoying.\\n- you can easily pick relic you don\\'t want i.e. if box opens and the game places the relic too close to your position as relics are automatically picked up.\\n- some relics are bugged. I.e. I lost flight ability from Amputation kit after continuing of a savegame from previous day\\n- ....',\n",

I have to say, it has not let me down. It doesn't have the graphics of counter parts in the genre, but it runs great, and performs incredible. Considering the size of the development team, I can only say I'm impressed. It has more of an old school kind of feel to it, but runs on Windows 10 x64 wonderfully. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that is into game play over eye candy.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Minor update 4.8.2019\\n\\nThey are really listening feedback on bugtracker, have implemented alot of features that were suggested, also skill bug was fixed in a day when i reported it on bugtracker. Game is starting to look good, but still has few multiplayer flaws. I will update once I've progressed enough characters at 100 to give fair updated review of game as whole.\\n\\nUpdate 13.5.2019\\n\\nTried the beta today, it feels like whole different game and i'm liking it. There's still some multiplayer bugs that need to be fixed. Updating review when beta ends.\\n\\n\\nHonest review of 31.12.2018\\n\\nAt the moment the multiplayer is so broken, its not even worth to try wormholes. Host takes literally 5x damage compared to players who join the host game. (Players who join will pretty much dodge every single projectile in this game) If you want to do physical damage, you have to be host (tested on target dummies -- about 7-10x difference). Some classes just feel so useless compared to others, so hope they will balance them out eventually.\\n\\nThere are some annoying bugs that can get you killed and couple of other frustrating things (few listed below).\\n- Total annihilation pillar goes outside of map (unavoidable death)\\n- Mobs spawn outside of map (quite annoying with some classes)\\n- Spawn minions mid air act 4 game crashes (with flying relic)\\n- Demon hunter skill boost pet follows other players and hits only 1. (Should do demon hunter damage)\\n\\nThe overall hack&slash part of the game is decent. Can easily burn couple of hours fun here & there, but anything over that it gets dull (diablo 3 style without real questline).\\n\\nDevs told that re-working multiplayer, so after that i'll update my review. If you are looking for support for the game, you will get help faster at discord instead of steam discussion.\",\n",

It provides some mild entertainment if you need to zone out for a while. Unfortunately, the biggest strike against this game right now is the lack of information. \\n\\nThere's really no direction or explanation of mechanics within or outside the game. I spent a couple of hours just online trying to find up to date information regarding the Wormhole mechanic to no avail. I did find original posts/guides back when these were new, posted by members of the community, so I can chalk that up to the game being 5 years old. \\n\\nThe devs appear to be constantly working on this, so I applaud them for that. I really think they should add documentation to the outdated wikis (maybe make an official one supported by them?), and reference it heavily so new players can figure out what to do. \\n\\n\",\n",

For the record, we\\'ve done port fowarding before for other games back then.\\n\\nNow, 3 years later, we still have issues. The new game seems to have a hosted multiplayer built into the game but even when creating a private server (NOT P2P) neither of us could see each other\\'s games. I read the forumns to try and solve by ensuring we had the right characters (both seasonal, both not hardcore) and nothing.\\n\\nThe game may be fun when you actually get into play but the inability for multiplayer to work well is an absoulte deal breaker. Other clear gaps in good user design are things like not showing what password requirements are upfront or not having a \"Create\" button when making a new character. You have to know to just press the \\'enter\\' key after typing your character\\'s name in.',\n",

I like games like this; but this product has lost its productive-ness as their development team has also lost their 'productiveness' and sense of community. \\n\\nI feel as if the developers have lost their focus...and that is a big deal for me. So I feel as if I should state my point by referencing things - and making a whole review about it; I just dont care to spend any more of my time on this development team or this product. \\n\\nAlso, as I had needed to preface with 'time spent' and 'way I play' I feel the need to preface this as well; I as their customer; purchased most of, if not all of their DLC during Steam Sale Events. Dropping this developer and this product will be similarly perceived as to eating a fast food value meal. Nothing lost...nothing gained. \\n\\nI will spend 0 more time in this game.\\nGood luck\",\n",

The seasonal stuff is great for competition as those characters just drop completely to non-season characters once it\\'s over instead of what I\\'ve seen plenty of other games do: delete them. However, the audio is definitely a major problem when it comes to multiplayer. I don\\'t want to hear my friend pushing a stone block on the other side of the map, or the traps going off, or them using skills, or spikes going up and down, or.... This game seriously needs positional audio. This isn\\'t new technology and has been around for years. Why isn\\'t it in this game.',\n",

(TL;DR, buy it, it's worth it's price, but you have to join their Discord, it's really useful for patches and see what's being worked on.)\\n\\nFor people who wants a more in dept review, you're welcome to stay with me.\\n\\n3.0 is out, and even tho the game isn't flawless (As I think it should be when a new season/version of a game goes live), the game is totally worth giving a shot. They balanced pretty much everything in the game (Still some flaw) and they keep on updating the content and listening to their community, which is, in my opinion, the biggest prop I can give them. \\n\\nThe game is now more-or-less a good Diablo-like game, grinding IS part of the game and trading IS part of the game. If you're not fan of this, you CAN play solo and have fun without grinding your ass off.\\n\\nWell, I don't know what else to say at the moment, but the game really does feel good to play now, and if you've seen bad reviews go by, watch the review date since 3.0 came out on July 2019, so everything before that I would recommend to not really think too much of it. I've played quite some hours at this game, and I can assure you that the 3.0 is TOTALLY different than what this game was before.\\n\\nGL to y'all and happy grinding!\\n\\n\",\n",

It's not big of a deal tho and lately I haven't seen any bugs with anything i'm really happy about the game I bought maybe a year ago and it just makes me happy to see that the creators are doing their job and giving their fans what they want.

       "  'review': \"WIth the new season, the creators of Hero Siege rolled out a change in the meta of the game that, quite frankly, was much needed.  Some of the negative reviews are knee jerk reactions to that, but it also has allowed people like me to come back and revisit the game and I'm liking what's done with it.\\n\\nThe game doesn't buck any trends or game types; it's a nice mix of ARPG and bullet-hell gameplay.  It has a pretty tight game loop where you get just the right type of feedback to keep playing.  Most of my gripes with the game are rather mundane like navigating some of the menus, but nothing grevious enough to make me throw the game out.  If anything a lot of the mechanics that frustrated me in the game have been fixed or removed, giving you a more enjoyable playthrough.  It's nice to see that mini bosses are tougher, that high level loot doesn't drop to early, and that really crappy one-hit kills are left for big boss skills.\\n\\nIt's a fun game, it's staying on my hard drive, I would encourage you to at least check it out in some capacity and give it a try.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"After 36 hours in 5 days, I think now I have enough insight to this game that I can write a review.\\nTLDR: I'm not going to play it anymore but it's been a fun 36 hours.\\n\\nHero Siege is what I can best call a Diablo demake. It has all the elements of what you expect from an action RPG but everything is simplified and this is a GOOD thing.  You don't have to worry about overly complicated talent trees or endless attributes that you have to learn about yet you still get the good old feeling of character building and you still obsessively want to grind for better items. IMHO this is what makes Hero Siege addictive: Simple learning curve yet still rewarding.\\n\\nHowever there are some frustrating things about it:\\n\\n1- For newcomers, it's impossible to find any documentation about anything. Even the game itself hides the details of some relics. But most importantly you don't understand the mechanics of how things work because it's not communicated throughout the game. For example we've spent quite a time figuring out why we couldn't level up in wormholes eventhough we've killed the bosses. Turns out you need the push a button after you kill the boss which in turn only appears if you kill all the minions before the timer (without a title) runs out. This is only a simple example. The game is full of vague things like this. What makes it worse is that there are no online information because apparently devs are changing the game constantly and people are tired of updating the informations in wikis etc...\\n\\n2- The game is buggy. For the 36 hours we've played this game we've had more than 5 crashes during the instances which in turn wiped all of our progress and made us spend wormhole keys for nothing. Also with an 8th gen i7 and mid tier GPU, on crowded places FPS drops below 10. I understand that there are literally hundreds of minions moving around but still this is unacceptable. It's not Crisis afterall.\\n\\n3- Europe servers are shit. I don't know about US, Brazil or China but I can only guess they are the same. Average ping is 300 most of the time.\\n\\n4- Lastly, the game is unbalanced. After 36 hours of fun, me an my teammates have concluded that we don't want to play anymore. We're all lvl 150 and started doing wormholes and toxic acts. After wormhole lvl 10, the game just become impossible to beat. Bosses kill you in single shot. We've been wiped more than 50 times in the short time we've started doing wormholes. It just became frustrating and boring after some time.\\n\\nThere you go. Hero Siege is one of the best and worst games you will play, at the same time.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Absolutely a great game! this game makes the grind worth it. put 20 hrs in with a friend playing local 2 player. We noticed 2 bugs that really effected our gameplay. Bug 1: Second player exp increases more than player 1, e.g. player 1 who is lvl 80 with 160k xp to lvl up while player 2 is a couple lvls behind who is lvl 78 but has a max exp of 190k to lvl up. I know for sure the player with lower lvl should be able to lvl a little faster than the higher lvled player. (we had to switch players 1 and 2 in the main menu then exit and switch back to fix the current exp) Bug 2: if player 1 is around anything u can activate such as picking up item, stash, or talking to an npc, player 2 can actually press the activate button and the items will go to player 1 or open stash/talk to npc if player 1 is close enough. (so running around picking up items i wanted actually went into player 1's inventory!) Still a great game! 9/10 dungeon crawler hack n slash galaga dodge ball kinda play style, keep up the great work devs! always a good game to open up and friends always seem to want to play!\\n\\nUPDATE: 11.22.2018 THIS GAME IS ON SALE FOR A KILLER PRICE, WANT TO BUY A 4 PACK TO GIFT TO FRIENDS BUT IT WONT LET ME, SAYS I ALREADY OWN IT AND THE PURCHASE BUTTON IS GREYED OUT. ive been able to purchase digital copies before even tho i own the game. please HALP\",\n",

A huge one.\\n\\nI don't really know what particular game I am reviewing.\\n\\nSince its release in 2014 Hero Siege recieved (suffered?) so many updates and patches that it is no longer the game we were buying back then. Oh, for crying out loud, it even isn't the game we were playing last week! It has seen gameplay design shifts, map edits, character wipes, skill swaps, class nerfs, you name it. Astonishingly, after all of these changes, it is once again unbalanced as hell.\\n\\nWe loved it. We hated it. We tried to leave. We came back.\\n\\nWhy? I guess because at its core it's still a fun and, I dare say, meditative experience. Because it's a great co-op game. Because you just can't beat Elias Viglione's pixel art.\\n\\nTherefore, yes. Recommended. Positive. I just hope that it won't have time to become a totally different game again, while I am writing this.\\n\\n----- An Update From 2019 -----\\n^^^ \\nThis came true in a blink of an eye.\\nOnce again, it's an entirely different game. A much more boring one, I'm afraid.\",\n",

This is my D3 fix on a less favorable rig or when traveling. Awesome idea and excellent execution! Fun times with friends again!',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game can be really fun... and/or frustrating as hell-- depends on how \"fun\" you find frustration.  You gather some nifty special equipment over the course of the crawl, all of which disappears if you die.  *When* you die.  You\\'ll do so a fair amount.  Honestly, I\\'d change the description to add the occasional bullet hell-- see below for why.\\nThis game has a lot of focus on grinding, in a way.  Sometimes, though, it seems like you can level up ridiculously quickly-- maybe that\\'s just my perception, though.  The bosses are interesting and randomized, to an extent, with the exemption of main bosses to end each zone, I guess you\\'d call it.  Once in a while, they can turn into a bit of a bullet hell-- or a lot of one.  It becomes a matter of recognizing a boss and remembering even vaguely how they fight, although some I have picked up on pretty quickly.  One of the best things for people who like to explore the entire area before the boss is that, while each map has a timer before the boss is ready, it won\\'t actually appear until you return to your starting point (where it spawns).\\nThe various characters have varied play styles as much as is possible for this kind of game.  It really comes out as you gain abilities.  There are only a few active abilities, and the trees are very short, but both active and passive skills can be incredibly useful.\\nThe range of equipment is mostly well-varied, but I have many times come upon some disappointingly weak equipment in later maps.  Each item has different stats, and choosing the right one for how you want to play is a matter of comparison.  Some come with attatched abilities, generally something that will spontaneously give you an extra attack passively, like launching three lines of fire in a spray in the direction you\\'re attacking.  Like in pretty much everything, the items are tiered-- common, rare, legendary, etc..  Getting a legendary item basically eliminates anything else you might find, which can get disappointing when you feel like you need a change.\\nOveral, this game is good.  It has it\\'s issues, yes, but they do actively work on fixes.  There\\'s more I could talk about, but I\\'ll cut off my rrambling with this:  If you\\'re mainly looking for a story, this is not the game for you.  If you like hack and slash with some scattered humor and unique items-- the ones that vanish when you die-- that give you special bonuses, I\\'d say give it a try.  If you\\'re not entirely sold, get it on sale.  It\\'s worth checking out.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game scratches that random loot and optimization itch you may have from other games like Diablo or Borderlands or Path of Exile. Recent balance changes have vastly improved the game; previously you would often die in one hit without always seeing what killed you even when playing on an approprioate difficulty.\\n\\nMake no mistake, this game is a grind. You will be playing the same acts and seeing the same enemies over and over again in your search for better gear to make further progress to.... get better gear. You should be playing this -because- of that gameplay loop, not in spite of it.\\n\\nLocal Offline Coop is a huge plus. You are screenlocked but it's nice to have an arcade style game that you can quickly pick up with a friend and go to town on.\\n\\nCharacter classes are decent, and it feels really rewarding to put a build together and utterly rock it.\\n\\nRelic diversity is a large minus. So many of them feel irrelevent. (Who wants an active that does the dmg of one of my auto attacks?)\\n\\nThe largest drawback of the game is the DLC-esque nature of the beast. The base game gets you a bunch of classes and four Acts that a newbie can breeze through on the newest difficulty in under two hours. For nearly another $3.50, you can grab Act V which comes with the Paladin class. Again, you will easily get clear that on a single difficulty within 30 minutes. Again for almost $3.50, you can get Act VI with just as much content (but probably the best Act Boss in the game). Now, if you want to play the three classes you don't already have (One class came each with Act V and Act VI) you're paying about $5 each. ($15)\\n\\nWhile I do reccomend the game, I have the reservation that you should wait until a sale and pick up one of the bundles. The content you get for each DLC in this game doesn't feel worthwhile otherwise.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I have a very complicated relationship with this game, and I don\\'t see it improving any time soon.\\n\\nYou can tell there\\'s a lot of passion put into the game, but it also feels like it was too busy focusing on what was cool or interesting that it forgot about what was fun. The game itself seems to be heavily based on Diablo and other loot games, and for the most part it does it well. Where it suffers, however, is that it is an ordeal in frustration, which I will explain below.\\n\\nFrom the get-go, the game has very poor UI design. The font choice is absolutely awful to read, being almost unable to read anything in small print (which is most of the game). Trying to read anything on screen is noticeably painful, and it remains an issue for the entire experience. Trying to manage items, runes, and abilities quickly becomes a chore. It becomes difficult to try and figure out what items are the most effective in slot. Information is often hidden away behind multiple button presses when there is little to no reason, and using a controller will make it irritating to go through menus. \\n\\nThen, the actual gameplay is repetitive and overly-flashy. Even less than an hour into the game you will have particle effects blocking your view, and actually understanding what is dealing damage to you is a struggle. Bosses often feel cheap due to seemingly random invincibility frames (or they end up throwing so many attacks at you that you can\\'t focus. It quickly becomes borderline Touhou.) There will be constant deaths that not only force you back to town, but also cause you to drop all the items you picked up, which can easily be a \"ragequit\" moment.\\n\\nCharacter design is rather questionable, and the voices alone will make you dig into your audio settings. The voices alone aren\\'t entirely bad, but they become extremely repetitive, and in some cases specific bosses will spam the same exact line over, and over, and over. The music isn\\'t very memorable, and the sound effects are little more than effective.\\n\\nWhile I am personally not extremely well-versed in Diablo/Torchlight and games similar, I do know that this was not an experience I particularly enjoyed. You can certainly try to find a fun time here if you already enjoy games like it, but I personally did not have a good time.',\n",

The dmg in the game make no sens, lets say you take like 10 - 40 dmg and gose okej this is not that hard and then all of a sudden BAMM 1000000 dmg makes 0 sens.\\n\\n2. The othere thing is that all of a sudden you can just die for no resson, i have playid this game for so long and evry time i just die for no resson.\\n\\n3. The quests need to be fixt some of them are a bit buggy and dont really work.\\n\\n4. The item drop is really bad takes ages befor you even get a desent uppgrade item or even close to what you need to play.\\n\\n5. The difficulty is whay of, lets say you pic normal it is yea it is okej and a level above that it is pretty good but then it just f spikes to hig. Diablo 3 has a good whay whit the difficulty leveling system so you get good items and paragon.\\n\\nIn othere words it is a good game in it self and the hole ide it is amazing however they need to fix some stuff to make shure you can really enjoy it all the whay. would i recomend this games to friends yeas i would and i will play it and i hope they fix it so we all can enjoy a awsome cool good game.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Preface: Originally I gave this game a Negative review due to having an unreadable font.\\nAs of the 8th of November 2018 they did patch in a new font. Overall this was a big improvement, I was now able to actually read the text without strain and headache. There is still some letters that look like they merge together and the number 3 looks like an 8 in some instances but I put that on my bad eyesight not the font now.\\n\\nNow that I have gotten several hours of gameplay in I am ready to update this review to give my honest opinion.\\n\\nI want to start out by saying I have played every single Diablo game for well over 7 thousand hours each.\\nI also have over 5k hours in Path of Exile so I have plenty of experience with these types of games.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n * It is fun, the gameplay is engaging from the very start, the abilites are fun and flashy and you feel strong (not Overpowered) from the very start which makes for a great experience to get into\\n.\\n* There\\'s a lot of content, apart from the acts you also have an end game system in the form of wormholes and to put it simply if you\\'ve played Diablo 3, think Great rifts, that is basically the system.\\n\\n* Varied classes, no class feels the same, instead each one give a different experience when playing and you are sure to find one that suits your style of playing the game.\\n\\n* The developers are quick to react to feedback. I and many others raised a complaint about the font and it was fixed after a little over a week. Which compared to some companies is lightning fast!\\n\\nThey are also quite active on their own Discord server and on the steam community hub, interacting and helping out the community, which is a big plus.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n * The controls. After about 2 hours of playtime my left hand started to feel very sore and this came from the fact that you have to constantly be contorting it in all manner of weird ways to hit all the different binds that comes with regular gameplay, especially when it comes to changing gear.\\n\\n* The Inventory system. It is really clunky for being on PC. It is very console friendly one could say.\\nFirst you use the arrow keys to select what piece you want to replace. Then you hit F to then be able to choose what you want to replace it with. When scrolling through the list of items with your arrow keys you have to hit R to even get to inspect what stats the item has, and there\\'s no comparison to what you have equipped!\\nInstead you have to manually look at each stat on both items to even figure out if something is an upgrade.\\nThen to stop inspecting an item you have to hit G, then F to equip it then G again to go back to select another gear slot.\\nThe biggest change needed here is to not have to hit R to inspect it, instead it should automatically show the item next to yours.\\n\\n * No Tutorial. None. Zilch. You go into the game completely blind and are expected to understand what each stat does or what items do or how they interact with eachother. Not even the stats are explained to you.\\n\\nFor example one of the first shaman \"talents/abilities\" you can choose tells me \"I need a totem skill\" to use it. Since it was named \"Storm totem\" I thought it was a \"Totem skill\" Nope. Turns out you needed \"Totems\" as well to even use it. But \"totems\" itself also deals damage so I thought they were separate and it goes on.\\n\\n* Several relics have no actual description of what they do. You pick them up and they say [Ability] ok great. I press it, nothing happens. I have to tab out and go to the wiki to find out it slows enemies on screen for a duration. Cool.\\nI get that they are going for the Binding of Isaac route, but it doesn\\'t work with this type of game!\\nBinding of Isaac you go through a run real quick at the start because you keep on dying, and later on a full run is like ~20-40 minutes. So you quickly learn what each thing does. But here you are in for the long haul and not knowing what things do is just frustrating.\\n\\nBasically expect to spend the first few hours of your playtime tabbed into the wiki to understand what even the most basic of things do for you. And there you will stay every single time you get an ability or relic that doesn\\'t even tell you what it does.\\n\\nTo summarize.\\nYes it is a fun game, You will definitively get value for your money as it is rather cheap even when not on a sale.\\nBut do yourself a favour, do NOT buy it if you don\\'t have a controller that plugs into your PC as you will quickly get RSI if you don\\'t.\\n\\nDo I recommend it?\\nBoth yes and no. If you got the money to spare and you like this type of game and you can stand having to consult a wiki. It is worth the purchase.\\n\\nIf you are a person who don\\'t like to tab out mid game, go for another title.\\n\\nFor me personally, as i said it is fun so I will keep playing it, but I will let my review stay on not recommended.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Review changed as of 10-31-18 - Game Patch has corrected tons of problems, changing my opinion to a cautious but impressed thumbs up.   Old review is below the ***** line, current review directly below:\\n\\nWelp, I gotta admit that VonFossFoss was 100% correct.  The recent patch really HAS changed the hell out of the doofier parts of this game.  I\\'m having crow for supper I guess.  It\\'s not eliminated all the problems - some dopey 1 shotting and such does still exist, but it\\'s greatly, GREATLY reduced.  The bosses, even the Reaper are far more sane in their damage output (most of the time anyway) and things are just generally a lot more frickin\\' sensible.  This is now playble, and pretty fun - at least at my current level of 43ish and in Act IV.  So far, this is one of the more astonishing patching efforts I\\'ve seen in a game.  It really does go miles and miles toward correcting the inexcusable stuff that used to be prevalent.  Pretty much what\\'s left that annoys me is either rare, or just \"Ehh I dunno if I like it that way, but it\\'s a preference thing, not \"OMG ugh.\"  Well done, PAS.  Hat\\'s off, you\\'re certainly at least way down the road and heading in the right direction.\\n\\n*******************************************************************************************************\\n\\nCould have been cool.  Instead they\\'ve quite purposefully kept it as a game full of cheap bs deaths, one shots, and walls like the Grim Reaper, who will proceed to bend you over about 823 times before you may get lucky and kill him.  Combine that with the constant \"Oh all the mechanics are totally fine, you just suck and need to get gud!\" no matter how the hell obviously bad they are, and you pretty much get a mess.  This really had some amazing potential, and it was pissed away in lazy design that caters toward the \"I enjoy having 939 monsters die the moment I look at them, and the 940th monster completely destroy me with an random cheapshot from offscreen - now that\\'s real difficulty!\" crowd.  Pretty much the same people you get in any game - the ones that would claim that being forced to fight a boss while on fire in real life and hanging from a spiked hook rammed through their skull suspending them from the ceiling just means that people that aren\\'t gonna do that suck at the game.  Avoid this - it\\'s irksome as hell to see something that\\'s actually kinda fun for about the first 20 levels degenerate into a tryhard-slobbering suckhole.\\n\\nThis is just plain poorly balanced, and poorly designed beyond the initial concept.  In the same sense that having auto brakes that randomly explode after 30 miles or so would be not warm anda fuzzy.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I refunded the game within 2 hours, due to:\\n\\n-Poor UI design (Unable to see each Item without clicking over it and entering to its own item menu, this makes comparing two items by checking each one's stats extremely difficult comparing to most RPG games since 1999. Some menu screens close/open with keyboard keys, some don't (No consistency). Why we have to use Keyboard keys for all inventory actions, instead of mouse? etc. etc.)\\n-Terrible SFX (shoutings are much louder than attack strikes, disturbing), \\n-Poor quest design (some quests seem to have no progress after passing several levels, such as collecting Holy Water. Also a quest given by Town Magician to Shock enemies with staff is not working), \\n-The amount of dialogues for an RPG are not satisfactory. No lore, description of the world are given. You directly start killing enemies without mission or reason. If I am forgetful (if a sentence of dialogue mentions this, sorry, that sentence was not enough to remind me why there are those enemies and why we need to purge them, etc. This is RPG, right?)\\n-Unbalanced item drops (having a legendary item that kills a miniboss in 2 strike is not entertaining, when almost all item drops permits you to strike 15-20 times weaker than that very legendary item given), \\n-Lastly excessive amount of Satanistic symbology (more than Diablo 2), which seeing Baphomet skull as game icon, use of Pentagram for rune placement were too much. \\n\\nOther than Cons on the above, these are the Positive things about the game:\\n-Nice Hack and Slash\\n-Procedural Maps (Although you don't feel the randomized map feeling much, as the maps are a little small and theme stays same)\\n-Satisfactory amount of various heroes\\n-Diablo style item trops\\n-Design of secret dungeons. \\n\\nIf you want to play a Hack and Slash game, there are many other good games to try. However this one has around 900 MB storage in computer, so if you need a small Hack and Slash game that reminds you Diablo series, then purchase it when on Sale.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I'd give this 6/10. I feel like the game has so much potential but a few things kill it for me - the potion freeze is incredibly annoying, I've only died a couple times from mobs except when stuck because I accidentally ran over a potion I didn't even see. The other real killer is that the bosses at the end of each world are just straight one hit kills. This is more frustrating because every single other enemy in the game is a joke. Most of the bosses at the end of each stage die just by quickly spamming all the character's abilities before they even have a chance to attack, and the same is the true of the world boss - the whole game really comes down to dodging 1 or 2 fast tricky shots. Now that said, I love the loot system, very cool relics, the different classes are a lot of fun. Just wish it was a bit more balanced all around.\",\n",

I’d think this wouldn’t be hard to do, including minor modifications to the interface. The online is not reliable at all.

For me, I enjoy it but I can’t really recommend it to anyone.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nArcade feel so the difficulty is welcome\\nVaries classes\\nPlaying is fun so the repetitiveness is not so dragging\\nBetter with friends\\n\\nCons:\\nOnline is unstable\\nNo 4 player local.

Then I logged in and had just picked my character and named him and went to the loading screen (main screen) so I coul pick my character and the game shuts done unexpectedly. Ok one time stuff happens but when I try to login again, and I get an error out them being down or my internet I hit the login again and pick my character and name them and then, at the same point the game shuts off on me again! I cant rate a game I cant even play so considering I cant get past the character select screen. guess what games getting a bad review! ugh so annoying, and they have this on Android and Iphone.. wow cant wait to see the problems on there end.',\n",

So I use cheat engine to give me a little start to get to a decent place and what do you know perma banned... Its not like its affecting other players negatively at all. Like I would understand this ban on a game that actually had pvp or something but this is just stupid Like seriously if I knew this would affect other polayers negatively then I wouldnt do it but since hero siege isnt that kind of game where is player vs player it should have been fine but no you ban anyway for no reason...

I will happily recommend this game once the devs fix this absolute trainwreck of a feature.\\n\\nEvery time you pick up a potion or Relic your character is stun-locked for a full two seconds (on higher difficulties, this will account for 80%+ of your deaths). It\\'s a bulls*** mechanic that almost single-handedly destroys the entire game. Yes, I know you can find a Relic that lets you pick up items without being stun-locked, but it shouldn\\'t be a Relic that you stumble across once every 50 play-throughs if you\\'re lucky. It should be a STANDARD FEATURE. \"Well then, just don\\'t pick the items up.\" The pacing of combat makes that fundamentally impossible.

       "  'review': \"It's not the best game in the world, but it's very good for the price. But if the price isn't what you are here for, go with something else. I wouldn't recommend this unless you're just looking to spend a couple dollars to sink an hour in a game.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very clunky UI especially with m+k, inspecting items uses RFG keys to navigate and equip/go back and the mouse control is dodgy.\\n2. Lots of loot variety but no shred of balance. My first play through I found a legendary immediately that had two more digits in every stat than anything else I found for the next 12 levels. Which is interesting and probably pretty lucky, but completely trivialized the game.\\n3. Abilities don't seem to use weapon damage, so #2 made my abilities pointless as well\\n4. Some items especially trinkets have modifiers that aren't described in game, and you have to check the wiki\\n5. Some bad game design with undodgeable enemies, or you get frozen for a solid 2-3 seconds while multiple enemies kill you and you can't do anything about it.\\n6. I don't think town portals let you return to where you were at and you have to start the level again. They're short, but it seems weird. Not sure if I missed something because this game doesn't communicate mechanics at all.\\n\\nFun game, but I would rather play Chronicon which has more interesting item builds and still just as many items and modifiers, but more balanced.\\n\\nThe other characters aren't described very well and all seem kind a bit weird.\\n\\nStill, lots of content for <$5. I don't know what everyone is talking about with the dev or microtransactions, I have no interest in any of that. You can get all the DLC  for less than $12 right now, that's certainly not microtransactions -- like League of Legends where you can sink thousands of dollars into the game.\",\n",

It's still being updated and sure, it might have some bugs but what game doesn't?  If you like RPG's like Diablo and similiar games, you would probably love this game.

       "  'review': 'Hero Siege:\\n\\nHero Siege is a god awful copy cat of an already popular game, Diablo. This game provides no unique story or bosses and to play the full game it would cost at least $40.00, including all the characters!\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. The Pixel art is fabulous and nice to look at.\\n2. The Area Bosses are fun to fight and its nice that they can have multiple difficulties.\\n3. Tons of different characters that can tailor to how you play.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. You cannot buy weapons, armor or items from the shops and there are no class only weapons or items.\\n2. The Dungeons are too short to be considered a secret area.\\n3. Items in the game should not belong, if it was a rougelite game it would be ok.\\n\\nScore:\\n\\nIn conclusion, i would give Hero Siege a 2/5, if it didnt have any unique characters or bosses then this for sure would have a final score of 1.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve played this game in various seasons and I can definitely say that now it is at it\\'s worst.\\nMain reasons:\\n- Traps, especially spikes always two-shot you. Can have lots of hp and armor, and still they will two shot you. Eventhough, enemies deal 0 damage to you.\\n- Don\\'t know why, but dev made every second or third enemy \"champion\" who on death explodes or poops out a trap which can instakill you (blue laser or any direct hit of bouncing pellets).\\n- Bosses are ruined at the moment. Dev doesn\\'t really grasp the concept of bullet hell. Almost every boss has a wall of projectiles which can instakill you no matter the tankiness. This is not bullet hell, this is garbage. Check Touhou games for good examples.\\n- Bugs. One for example, after killing Act III boss, when his HP bar disappeared, a wall of lightning appeared and instakilled me. This was a good moment to pause and write a review.\\n- Too much crap on the screen. There can\\'t be one shot mechanics when you can\\'t see things because of your passive items, auras and abilities.\\n- This is a combination of aforementioned things. When a game is far from perfect, never shift a game to a instakill bullet hell especially when it should be RPG game. Stats mean almost nothing. Raising stats can shorten time of defeating a boss but they can\\'t protect you. Armor and hp stats are pointless.\\n- Hardcore mode when terrible game design and bugs instakill you. Lel.\\n\\nIf dev decides to pause the release of gamebreaking stuff and fix past mistakes, I will change my review. But at the moment no one should buy this game.\\n\\nEDIT: 1 Year later and this game is still trash. Traps still deal % damage, every second enemy poops out projectile trap, bosses still have random invincibility moments and you can still get one shot by undodgable boss attacks. For example with Anubis, if you are on the same side where randomly wall of lightning spawns, you are instakilled. I hoarded tons of relics, stats, all items where purple with hp and armor bonuses - oneshot.\\nAlso new DLC character Plague Doctor is total trash. Stupid plague proc gimmick, which deals very low damage. Short attack range. Low spell damage. Idiotic passives like 20% chance that auto attack will trigger a puddle, which deals low damage and has a 20% chance to proc one stack of low damage plague. Wowzers. 15 points invested in plague mastery gives ~1% plague damage boost, dunno if tooltip is wrong or devs are drunk.\\n\\nStay away from this game, it is doomed.',\n",

I liked this game when I saw it, but I bought it for so long that I wanted to play and I didn't want to play. If the developer can take my two suggestions seriously, it might be able to retain more players like me。\\nFirst, I strongly hope that the picture can be flipped 90 degrees as a whole, because I prefer cross-board fighting to oblique fighting.

       "    'review': \"Have you ever wanted to explore Greek Mythology while having a radical political ideology shoved down your throat? Then Hades has got your back!\\n\\nYou can explore the Greek Pantheon, the various Gods and their personalities, and how Athena and Ares are inexplicably black in this game. Remember: Changing a black character to a different race is racist, but changing a nonblack character into a black one is not, somehow!\\n\\nLearn about Greek heroes of old! King Theseus is portrayed as a self-important buffoon, while Achilles is a wise, thoughtful, virtuous mentor. And gay, as any virtuous man has to be, apparently.\\n\\nDo you need some heterosexual relationship representation in this game? There's one of those too! It is between a strong, independent woman and a weak, cowardly man who takes credit for her work. Because that's how all heterosexual relationships work, right?\\n\\nYes, I've played a ton of this game. I'm not gonna mince words, the gameplay is great. I just really, really dislike the racist, hateful message that comes with it.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"As a huge fan of rouge-likes/lites, SuperGiant does it again. Extremely addicting gameplay loop, awesome aesthetic, sound design, and amazing voice overs. Runs like a dream on a 1080ti. \\n\\nPros:\\n[*] Great upgrade system\\n[*] Addicting gameplay loop\\n[*] Combat is fun, fluid, and fast. The utilization of attacks, specials, skills, buffs, debuffs, movement, and dodge rolls, combine to create an easy to play, hard to master scenario that doesn't ever get old. \\n[*] Engaging characters / story in a genre that somewhat glosses over this. Similar to Dead Cells where the lore is gained throughout. \\n[*] Load times are minimal\\n\\nCons:\\n[*] Only 5 weapons. You unlock how these weapons react while progressing, but the base of the weapons never really change. Would love to see more. \\n[*] Magic is somewhat limited. Upgrades and progression can change your magic and how it works, but it's not nearly as engaging as the other combat aspects\\n[*] Map designs are cool but simple. I would love to see much more complexity in the maps. Also, traps are INSANELY irritating\\n\\nOverall, for its price, I recommend this game to anyone who loves hack-n-slash, beat-em-ups, rouge-like/lites, ARPGs, and a good old fashioned emphasis on strong combat. I've been having a blast, and I think you will too.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'This game is a lot of fun. 8/10.\\n\\nMinimal spoilers in this review.\\n\\nThe game-play is fast paced and action packed. Fighting style is varied depending on which weapon you pick. Each weapon has a few \"aspects\" which alter their game-play further. You are constantly trying to dodge while dishing out as much damage as possible. Quite rewarding when you can clear a difficult encounter without taking any damage. Hit boxes feel pretty fair, none of the fights are TOO hard (except maybe the end game pact of punishment boss fights). There are plenty of \"boons\" to find during each escape attempt which keeps game play refreshing and combo-ing builds is half the fun.\\n\\nThe art is absolutely beautiful. Every character is amazing to look at, the rooms are colourful and fitting for their respective environment. After a few hours of game play you will recognise some of the rooms and remember what enemies are likely to spawn in them (this is bittersweet in my opinion). Occasionally perspective will mess you around a little bit and things that look like they shouldn\\'t go past a certain object will, though this mainly just takes getting used to.\\n\\nThis game doesn\\'t have a proper ending (Yet), But there is plenty of dialogue and story progression despite this. The characters are very charming and have interesting personalities. The voice acting is almost perfect, with only a few lines and phrases feeling out of place. Many characters are discovered after a certain amount of time playing the game (I assume its measured in number of escape attempts and how far you got in said attempts). At some point you are given a codex and you can unlock information about characters by interacting with them. There is specific dialogue for certain characters based on the weapon and weapon augment you have equipped, as well as if you have recieved any blessings from other gods.\\n\\nThere are upgrades to yourself, your weapons and the house of Hades. You use certain collectables from each escape attempt to upgrade various things, Such as stat boosts, house decorations, weapon augments and more. You can unlock \"infernal troves\" which initiate a timed challenge for certain rewards. You can find these troves randomly during your escape attempt after unlocking them. YOU CAN FISH IN THIS GAME. \\n\\nI have experienced minimal bugs, aside from a game crash or two (which was most likely caused by my old hardware) but progress is saved frequently enough so you don\\'t have to restart from the beginning. The only other bugs are collision boxes in certain rooms and areas (like near the wine barrels in the lounge near the ghost chef).\\n\\nNot the most detailed review ever but I hope my take on it helped someone purchase the game, As it is very worth it. \\n\\n',\n",

It's an absolute blast with scaleable options for difficulty: There's a God Mode you can toggle that buffs your damage resistance up to a maximum of 80%, there's The Pact of Punishment that gives you optional difficulty modifiers to make things A LOT more challenging, and you can give yourself self imposed challenges like not using persistent upgrades - the game is still beatable that way too, it's still a fair Rogue-lite that is not dependent on grinding out long term upgrades like some others in the genre,\\n\\nAs far as story content goes, while Hades is not as story heavy as other SuperGiant games, Hades might have the most writing in any SuperGiant game period, it's just spread out over a longer period of time to ensure you still have new stuff to enjoy on new runs. There's a wide cast of characters with colorful personalities who I am absolutely invested in. There isn't much of a main story due to the nature of the game, mostly just the goal to escape the underworld for reasons I won't go into. It is worth saying, however, the game currently doesn't have an ending, I think SuperGiant are saving that for the full release. You can still clear the game, but the story does not get any resolution, so just know that during the Early Access period. \\n\\nAnd other than that, it's still a SuperGiant game which means top tier polish across the board, gorgeous visuals, and an incredible soundtrack. I don't think Hades will ever dethrone Transistor for me, but it's still a game I'll be playing for a long, long time, and loving every minute of it. Can't recommend it enough.\",\n",

Now my thumbs are sore (handle)\\n\\nThe dubbing is very good. Each character's voice line has its own characteristics, which makes me feel that the character is fuller. The script can also experience that it is done by heart. At present, it has been cut back 11 times. Every time I come back, there will be different dialogue and complete dubbing, very attentive\\n\\nBut the localization hasn't been finished yet. When Hades was scolded by his father for the first time, he skipped it because he couldn't use his mobile phone to take photos and translate. There were many fragmentary texts that hadn't been translated. There were also some mistakes in skill translation, and some subtitles of animation didn't be translated\\n\\nI hope to become invincible when I sprint. I rushed to the enemy's face who is releasing skills dozens of times and paid a lot of tuition fees\\n\\nWhat's more, my reaction is up-to-date, and the action of the character is not up-to-date. I hope the production team will pursue reality less, and let the player manipulate the character at will more often. The interrupt attack of the interrupt attack (although the front swing of the action is quite short)\\n\\nPlease increase the trap triggering time by 0.1-0.2s. Although trap schools are also good, they are a little disliked by non trap schools. You can use resident traps instead of triggering traps\\n\\nThe rifle is difficult to use. When approaching the limit of attack distance, there will be a serious decline in accuracy. The trajectory and time of special attack grenades need to be predicted is a little long, hoping to reduce the falling time by 0.3-0.7s\\n\\nThe angle of view is very confusing for me. The current figure model is too small on the map. It's not obvious. I often can't find myself in the battle of Hydra. I'm crazy about eating missiles. But you need to change it a little bit smaller. When using rifle grenades, I can't see the enemies within the farthest attack distance in the vertical direction. The fatter and higher figure model means the larger area to be hit. I hope to have a good one Resolvent\\n\\nI often miss the door of chaos and treasure chest challenge. I hope to add a dialog box to decide whether to give up the door of chaos or treasure chest challenge before going to the next copy. Although there will be a hint in the background music, I will forget that there is still a treasure chest after I finish a picture. It is clear that I bought the props of the door of chaos in the next room last time\\n\\nIt may be that too many dubbing has increased the cost. Although the current game experience is excellent, it is still insufficient, and it is still in the beta stage. Players who want to start can wait for a year or two. When the weapon type, weapon damage, boss damage, and matching school are relatively stable, they can start\\n\\nBy the way, if you can't find the blessing of common attack lightning ball when you use the rifle, the damage is really low\",\n",

       "    'review': '39 часов боли. И всё из-за того что мой кампутир параша. Вылеты, бесконечные лаги из-за которых я очень часто умирал, вылеты с последующим перепрохождением забега т.к. моё местоположение не сохранилось, прозрачная текстурка меню (до сих пор не знаю почему это случалось) и потом эпилептический психодел в главном меню. Из этого описания может показатся что игра плохая, но нет. Даже учитывая всё вышеперечисленное, я наслаждался игрой. Да было неприятно, но игра того стоила. Ещё по минусам: нет достижений. Просто мне хочется каких то шуточек-прикольчиков в достижениях, так что это, наверное, по вкусу. А теперь к плюсам: все ваши улучшения отображаются на вашем оружии. К примеру возьмём меч: вы подбираете благословение Зевса на удар, и при ударе след от вашего оружия жёлтый и испускает молнии. Мелочь, но приятно. Идём дальше. 3 красочные локации, 10 различных богов, и множество их благословений, Аспекты для оружия которые дают улучшения вашему вооружению, после его сбора, и различные улучшения вашего хаба, косметические, функциональные, и улучшения ваших забегов, по типу \"Хилки регенят больше хп\". И много, много чего ещё. Выводы вы делайте сами, \"играть или не играть?\". Лично я не жалею ни копейки потраченой на эту игру. Пока!',\n",

       "    'review': \"Awesome roguelite dungeon crawler with extremely fast-paced action, dynamic powerups, enemies and levels each run.  Doesn't hurt that the music is amazing and always seems to keep pace with the scenery, story and action.  The voice-acting is the cherry on top to round out the setting.  I would also be remiss if I did not point out that It is one of the few games out there with extremely tight, responsive controls that makes me realize that I still have some usable reflexes left.\\n\\nIt may not be out of early access yet, but I couldn't wait for the Linux client to become available, so I run it in Proton--which is not without its limitations--I still get some hitchy stuttering when the action gets thick.  It's not horrible or game-breaking, but I have a pretty beefy rig, and would appreciate a native Linux client for this game, just like Supergiant Games did for Bastion, Transistor and Pyre.  \\n\\nI'm blown away with what I've seen so far.  Supergiant Games has outdone themselves with this one.\\n\\nIf you loved Dead Cells and/or Wizard of Legend, you'll love this one too.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Wow! what a game! where to begin... I was thinking about buying Wolcen and in the near future i will probably buy that game still but this Gem just came out of nowhere for me. Hell i dont even like Roguelike/lite that much and after 1 hour in i already knew this was something special. I dont wanna spoil anything but let me tell you this. \\n\\n* Impressive art style that fits in every pixel of your screen. Its lovely, its distinct and its gorgeous\\n* Combat feels something like Diablo or twin stick shooters from back in the day but everything here is more fluid. every button press is instant\\n* The game has great voiceovers (all interactions are voiceovers wich is impressive because the immersion is off the chart in this game)\\n* Great RPG elements that has different rarity and a unique playstyle for most of the runs u do, \\n* Just great systems that work in a clever manor choosing between Reward or convenience. Gold or Life. \\n\\nI can write for hours because this game made me realise how much i miss the surprise factor that almost no Triple A games give these days. For me this game is a solid 9.5/10 and i hope to see lots of more content in the near future! \\n\\nLove from The Netherlands',\n",

Музыка, атмосфера, дизайн уровней на высшем уровне, погружаешься в каждый из миров целиком и полностью, Hades, конечно, еще в раннем доступе, но уже есть чем заняться, да и тематика мифологии Древней Греции очень импонирует. \\nГГ узнает, что Персефона является его родной матерью, а не Нюкта, как ему внушали все эти годы, и пытается сбежать из царства своего отца Аида, который не намерен так просто отпускать своего буйного сына. Олимпийцы с удовольствием готовы принять своего племянника, и сам Хаос на стороне главного героя, но все они почти бессильны на вотчине Аида. Загрею предстоит тяжелый путь наверх... и вам.',\n",

       "    'review': 'Hades ist ein gutes Spiel... Aber es ist kein gutes Supergiant Spiel.\\n\\nOder anders, [b]für mich haben sich Supergiant Spiele bisher immer durch eine ausgezeichnete Mischung aus Story und Gameplay ausgezeichnet[/b]. \\n\\nHades aber geht einen anderen Weg: [b]es stellt das Gameplay vorne an und ordnet die Story diesem fast vollständig unter[/b].\\n\\nDabei entsteht dann ein Spiel, dass zwar viel Spaß zum spielen macht, aber keine emotionale oder gar mitreißende Story erzählt. Noch schlimmer, weil man im Vergleich zum erleben der Story einen überwältigenden Anteil der Zeit mit nicht story-relevanten Kämpfen verbringt, geraten die nach wie vor gut geschriebenen Texte noch weiter in den Hintergrund. Dabei hilft es dann leider auch nicht, dass die Vertonung gut ist.\\n\\nEbenfalls nicht so gut wie bei Bastion, Transistor und Pyre finde ich den Soundtrack: weniger markant, weniger abwechslungsreich, weniger tolle Vocals.\\n\\nDann merkt man leider auch, dass die Entwickler hier Elemente aus z.B. Bastion recycling: von Gegner-Designs, über Animationen und Gameplay-Details. Hades ist ein behutsames Update von dem, was schon Bastion geboten hat, minus der Story.\\n\\nJa, das Spiel ist noch nicht fertig und dafür hat es schon durchaus eine zufriedenstellende Menge an Content. Dennoch zweifle ich daran, dass man noch eine Story auf dem Niveau eines Pyre oder Transistor erzählen wird.\\n\\n\\n[b]Fazit:[/b] wer das Spiel vor allem wegen dem Gameplay kauft, der kann hier absolut bedenkenlos zuschlagen. Wer aber Story, Charaktere und Emotionen erwartet, der wird enttäuscht werden und schaut sich besser etwas anderes an.\\n\\n\\nPS: wenn das Spiel fertig ist, werde ich es noch mal spielen. Bis dahin aber habe ich nach einem Durchlauf erst mal genug.',\n",

       "    'review': \"the good: This game is absolutely incredible. It takes the experimentation and near infinite build possibilities of other rogue-likes and combines it with a solid narrative and great characters, as well as an ever-evolving story as you learn more and more about the world. Currently 5 weapons (soon to be 6 apparently) with several forms of each, as well as countless different upgrades you can take each run based on what god you speak to. Build possibilities are nearly endless, combat is fluid, fast paced, and satisfying, art is incredible and stunning. \\nthe bad: Obviously it's in early access, and while the game is fantastically well polished, there ARE some bugs here and there that might annoy you. Not to mention some things are still being balanced, so don't expect all builds to be viable. There's no graphics options other than resolution, and while the game IS easy to run, I question how any game in 2020 could have no graphics options on PC. Finally, some of the in game economies still need some balancing, the big one being Titan Blood, which you need to upgrade weapons and unlock new forms. I HIGHLY suggest getting a mod to reduce upgrade costs.\\n\\nOverall, this game is absolutely amazing, and well worth what's being asked for it. If you like games like Dead Cells or Binding of Isaac, I strongly suggest you give this game a shot.\",\n",

At the same time, this is the most fun I have had in absolute years. I love the sass, the bright colors, the absolutely chaotic fighting. I love bashing things in the face with a shield that looks like an eye. I love dashing over lava over jumpy-butt motherhumpers. I love collecting gems so I can hang a portrait of Aphrodite in my bedroom like some kind of weirdo. I just absolutely love this game. I don't care if I ever win. I just want to run around like some meth-addicted psycho with a shield.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'After ~40 hours I can say Hades is definitely a game worth buying If you\\'re a fan of roguelikes and/or Supergiant games in general.\\n\\nWhile the game is still in Early Access, Hades itself offers a good amount of content already. The combat is very addicting, with 4 weapons to choose from. Each weapon has up to 4 \"aspects\" you can equip (as of the Long winter update, the spear is the only one with 4 aspects), which change the gameplay loop significantly and offer a variety of  choices on how to approach. \\nBoons from the gods, which help the young prince Zagreus  escape from this hell, change how you tackle your current attempt as escaping. \\nMaybe you prefer the mighty zeus and his lightning-chain based attacks? Or you enjoy raining down big numbers through the crit-based boons of the goddess of the hunt, artemis? The choice is up to you.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is a treat to enjoy, and in my opinion the biggest enjoyment are the characters itself: Each character - from the inhabitants of the House of hades, the bosses or the gods of olympus - have a variety of dialogue, referring to one other or even talking amongst them.\\n\\nA TL;DR Version: I highly recommend playing it due to the following reasons: \\n\\nAmazing gameplay loop\\nWide Variety of choices (Weapon upgrades, boons, aspects, keepsakes)\\nAmazing soundtrack\\nChallenging Bossfights\\nAdjustable difficulty through the Pacts of Punishment (Available after clearing the final boss the first time)\\n\\nOh and also: You can pet the dog.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'review': \"This game isn't finished as of yet. And it's absolutely wonderful. I'm a fan of games like this where each run has so much variety. I enjoy being able to swap between all the weapons which adds quite a bit of variety in playstyle, I like the weapon upgrades per run that also make each run different as you try to mix and match synergistic combinations. Runs don't get stale gameplay-wise as they inevitably change as you get buffs and weapon upgrades each run which alter how you try to deal your damage to enemies and avoid their strikes. \\n\\nI like the heat mechanic added in after finally making it out the first time as well. Adds so much more replayability as you can to choose how the game gets even tougher! The upgrades all feel meaningful and effective both inside and outside of runs. I can't wait for this game to get even more content! Definitely incredibly fun for anyone who enjoys this genre and likes fast paced action. \\n\\nDid i mention that it's awesome to be able to pause the game? It's great to be able to pause the game and leave it open for any amount of time. I've come back 2 days later to finish a run I was in the middle of before because I got busy. Just a really nice quality of life thing, doesn't take up much cpu or anything either. I can leave it paused and play other graphically intense games with no issues on my laptop. \\n\\nAlso, Cerberus is the goodest doggo.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"If you're a fan of rogue-lites, Greek mythology (with a few embellishments), and an interesting story embedded in crazy combat, then you should absolutely pick this up. As others have said it honestly feels like a full release game despite being in early access, and dying and losing your progress through the levels is not near as frustrating here as I've found it in other games. The art design is outstanding (though this isn't too much a surprise considering the great work that's been done in the developer's other games, such as Transistor) and the attention to detail is outstanding. In addition some elements that are a bit less rewarding (such as Darkness, a form of currency to level up your character between runs) are being actively worked on along with further content being added--and every dialogue line is voiced! I've rarely seen that in high-budget triple A titles, nevertheless something from a smaller developer. Now that this is available on Steam (rather than exclusive to another platform...) I would absolutely recommend this.\",\n",

On this it's hard to stop because you die, you got to spend what you earned, and now you want to try what you just unlocked.\\n\\nMostly everything is voice acted, and I'm amazed at the amount of stuff the characters can say. Seems like Hypnos has a thing to say for every way you died.\\n\\nAlso, this doesn't feel like an early access game at all. I feel like they could release it like this and it would be fine.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Ce jeu impose un sacré record pour moi : Celui de prouver que c\\'est un bon jeu en moins de 2 minutes !\\nIl a le gameplay, les graphismes, le contenu et l\\'histoire !\\n\\nC\\'est assez dingue à constater d\\'ailleurs ! Je l\\'ai acheté ce matin et y ai joué 7 heures d\\'affilés. \\n\\nNe serait-ce que le menu est carrément bien fait ! C\\'est fou ! L\\'OST magnifique, tout est soigné ! Il y a énormément de dialogues, jamais les mêmes. Le contenu des dialogues est très mure.\\nOn incarne un jeune homme, fils d\\'Hades et papa ne nous aime pas trop .. Il n\\'oublie jamais de nous le faire remarquer d\\'ailleur : \\n\"C\\'est à cause de toi que cerbère à détruit le salon, parceque tu ne t\\'en occupe pas bien.\", \"Ils me refusent même l\\'installation d\\'un cadrant solaire, à cause de l\\'ombre que tu portes à la famille.\" ( Ce ne sont pas les paroles exact, mais ce qu\\'elles expriment y est.). \\nJ\\'apprécie vraiment d\\'avoir de vrais personnages, avec une personnalité authentique, un caractère propre, une identité qui manque à beaucoup d\\'autres jeu.\\n\\nEt le gameplay, olalala ... C\\'est un vraie tuerie !  ça faisait longtemps que des combats ne m\\'avaient pas autant fait plaisir ! Esquive, combo d\\'attaque, attaque spéciale 1 et 2 sont nos seules touches de combats et c\\'est laaaargement suffisant ! La tension est élevée pendant les combats, c\\'est dynamique, nerveux, c\\'est beau, ça frappe fort .. On sent clairement l\\'impact de nos coup et les effets sont carrément magnifique. Le monde vivant n\\'oublie pas les épreuves qu\\'on a traversé et il évolue lui aussi, d\\'une manière remarquablement propre et cohérente d\\'ailleurs.\\n\\nSelon moi, Hades est clairement un produit haut de gamme pour un prix vraiment raisonnable. Je ne connais pas la taille du studio qui bosse dessus mais ils n\\'ont pas à être jaloux de ce qu\\'il se fait à cotés, bien au contraire. \\nBref, un chef-d\\'oeuvre !\\n\\nAller, quelques points que j\\'aurai bien aimé avoir :\\n-Un RNG plus équilibré\\n-Un mode multi\\n\\nNote : J\\'ai vu le jeu sur EG avant qu\\'il sorte sur steam et .. Je sais pas trop, je le sentais pas. Ce n\\'est qu\\'en voyant le nombre impressionnant de bonnes critiques steam que j\\'ai décidé de l\\'acheter. Je ne suis clairement pas déçu. Le système de review de steam est vraiment une bonne chose pour les jeux qui méritent !',\n",

       "    'review': 'Wonderful game! Can\\'t wait to see what it\\'s like on full release.\\n\\nCombat is tight and fun, enemies seem fair and balanced for the most part. Most bosses feel completely OP when you first fight them but the more you fight them the more you see their patterns and realize what you need to do. My one complaint would be the artifacts seem poorly balanced, The artifact that gives a percentage of health back when picking up Darkness seems very strong (a good thing) but most of the others don\\'t seem all that useful. I only have about half of the Artifacts unlocked so some of those may be strong as well. Haven\\'t completed a full run yet so that also may change things.\\n\\nThe perk that gives 10% damage when your cast is in the enemy is a game changer, level that one up as early as you can.\\n\\nOverall a wonderful game! I\\'ve spent most of my time since I purchased it playing, has been stealing time away from my other games. Even after a bad run if I decide to take a break I\\'ll usually go watch a video to get some ideas to beat whatever I\\'m stuck at and that will make me immediately want to play more. Definitely a \"one more run\" game.\\n\\nI was concerned that there wouldn\\'t be enough content when I purchased it but I would personally view this as a complete game if no one told me otherwise. Ready to see some more of the weapons they\\'re adding to the game!',\n",

       "    'review': 'Alles an diesem Spiel macht Riesenspaß. Unholde, Untote und andere Wächter der Unterwelt abmurksen natürlich, aber auch die Rahmenhandlung kann sich sehen lassen. Sie bedient sich mit Genuss an allen Gestalten der griechischen Sagenwelt, die nicht rechtzeitig die Bäume hochgekommen sind.\\n\\nRoguelike-Fans gegenüber muss klargestellt sein, dass dieses Spiel das exakte Gegenteil des Permadeath-Konzeptes verfolgt. Zagreus, Sohn des Hades, [b]kann[/b] gar nicht sterben. Er ist schließlich ein Gott, und Götter sind unsterblich. Das funktioniert wunderbar für dieses Spiel und die Rahmenhandlung. Ich kann auch gut verstehen, dass die Entwickler wohl kaum freiwillig auf das Wort \"Rogue-like\" fürs Marketing verzichten würden.\\n\\nAlle anderen sollten sich auch bewusst sein, dass die Handlung des Spiels unvollständig ist. Der letzte Akt fehlt... oder vielleicht sogar noch mehr Akte, die danach kommen, so genau kann man das nicht wissen. Je nachdem, wie wichtig euch also ganz speziell die Handlung ist, kann es sich lohnen, bis zum Release zu warten. Das Gameplay selbst ist absolut komplett und großartig.\\n\\nHades ist ein brilliantes Hack\\'n Slash Action RPG. Fans der Diablo-Reihe sollten absolut auf ihre Kosten kommen. Es ist kein Roguelike, aber ein Spiel muss nicht Roguelike sein, um gut zu sein.',\n",

With Bastion I had issues with replay ability, but with Hades game it's so easy to say just one more run. I'm not great at rouge likes, but Hades has story progress even when you get a bad run which keeps me engaged for hours. I highly recommend. I can't wait for the full release.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"It is an extremely good game that is seeing a lot of additions that keep on making the game more enjoyable. If you like Greek mythology and you enjoy story in your Roguelike, this is a great fit. Albeit, you don't need to read/listen to any of the dialogue, which makes it fit both bills. Every line in the game has dialogue to it (I think), which makes the game even more enjoyable to me. Although, it is in early access, so the amount of endgame content that doesn't include doing the same few levels is not there yet. I am looking forward to future updates to this game, which will hopefully include more gods/goddesses, new enemies/levels, and more content in the endgame.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Najlepsza gra rogue-like dungeon crawler na rynku. Prawdopodobnie lepszy jest tylko Dead Cells, który jest rogue-like metroidvanią. \\nBardzo dobry voice acting, gra która wciąga w swój świat i fabułę, Postacie, których nie da się nie lubić, każda ma w sobie coś charakterystycznego i naprawdę wiele możliwości buildów, alternatywnych zagrań oraz poziomu trudności możliwego w regulowaniu aż do stopnia przewyższającego souls-like gry. \\nJedyną wadą na ten moment jest całkiem mimo wszystko wysoka powtarzalność, brakuje większej różnorodności co do broni jak i samego rozwoju dungeonów w ciągu rozgrywki. W pewnym momencie każdy run, mimo losowości i nadanych przez nas zmian, jest mniej więcej podobny/taki sam w swej podstawie. Jest to zarazem też główna różnica, która sprawia, że takowy Dead Cells już nie mówiąc o legendarnym The Binding of Isaac, prezentuje się na dłuższą metę po prostu ciekawiej, a na pewno bardziej pochłania z czasem, mimo, że nie nadają aż takiej immersji jak Hades.  \\nTrudno jednak zarzucić grze jakiekolwiek wady w innych aspektach, jest cholernie dynamiczna i wykonana z największą dbałością, jeśli weźmiemy jeszcze pod uwagę fakt, że to wciąż early access i wiele rzeczy może być nadal zmienione i ulepszone to napawa mnie tylko optymizmem ku myśli, że nie jest to gra mająca na ten moment godnych konkurentów prócz jednej/dwóch wymienionych wcześniej. \\nPolecam każdemu, nie tylko osobom, które lubią ten typ rozgrywki, ale także osobom, które chcą może zaryzykować w ten gatunek i spróbować czegoś nowego.',\n",

       "    'review': '真的是我玩过打斗最爽的Roguelike类游戏了，非常喜欢这款的画风和背景，神作无疑了，希望越来越多玩家加入进来。\\n吐槽一下：\\n1.混沌之神是不是应该有一些更强的恩赐，毕竟是需要付出21血换来的恩赐，应该比其他神明恩赐更有特殊点\\n2.牛头人竞技场的柱子是不是模型还是不够完善，为什么有的时候半个身子进去了都撞不上，有时候就蹭了一下就能撞上？？？（的确不是我电脑的问题）\\n3.打完boss的那个卖恩赐的界面，希望能全部列出来，本来想存钱一路都是躲着商店的，结果boss房前面硬是就一个商店的时候还不能留着钱，如果打完boss想买口血没钱就得卖恩赐，但是随机抽三个很重要的或是高等级的，也不忍心卖，感觉就一点用都没有，还反倒有些搞心态。\\n4.那个美杜莎的装备啊，这个4%4%4%（注意这个数字啊喂）概率出血药，难道真的不是每个房间必出且仅出一个吗！？因为之前手机上都在玩soul knight，说实话那个掉血包的概率个人还是感觉不错的，当然电脑上的话难度要提高掉率自然应该低一些，那不妨设个7/8%的概率掉，有的屋子掉得多，有的反而可能不掉，这样更能增加玩家打罐子时候的那种期待感，如果玩家有那种没事下个房间还有一瓶药可以吃的感觉，那就少了一种乐趣。。。再不然你就直接把装备介绍改成每个房间必定掉落血药。\\n这也是第一次给一款游戏写评测，真心希望这个游戏能越做越好，有越来越多的人进来玩，加油加油！！！',\n",

       "    'review': \"One of the best, if not the best, Roguelike game, and it's just early access.\\n\\nI'd say that even Dead Cells doesn't have as satisfying combat as Hades. The characters in Hades also make the world and your journey way more dynamic and interesting. The amount of voice lines the different gods (or other npcs) have is actually astounding, even after 20 hours i feel like I've not heard anything twice.\\n\\nThe progression is also extremely satisfying with passive bonuses that you upgrade. And those passive bonuses don't really make you that much op, which is very nice. In this game, you feel the progress quite a lot, even if you die, you feel like you progressed, which is something a lot of games don't achieve. \\n\\nBosses are quite well done as well. They also have great lines and you even have few variations of one boss, which makes the journey not as repetitive and keeps things fresh. I didn't feel like there were any bad designs or anything of that kind, so i'd say well done here.\\n\\nOverall, This game, even in early access, is almost as good as Dead Cells. I don't think it has the more long term progression Dead Cells has, but it's just early access so it makes sense. It also has the story, characters, that make the world feel more alive and dynamic, which is something Dead Cells doesn't really have, so in that regard it actually triumphs over it. \\n\\nIf you like Roguelike games, this is a must buy. You will get tons of hours of great content with great characters and progression that keeps you playing for a while.\",\n",

The game is easily enough of a challenge with or without god mode. \\n\\nThere are plenty is unique powers, weapons and trinkets what help you develop different tactics for the boss fights, without making game play too easy. The sound has been done extremely well, the music in the boss fights gets the blood pumping and each time you die, you're motivated to make it further than last time.\\n\\nThe voice acting is an actual joy and each character is very well distinguished as well as being fun to converse with. Overall i think it's a fantastic game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to test their skills in a dungeon style game! I will give this game a 9/10! \\n\\nI hope this review helps other gamers who have taken an interest in this game but are yet to make up their minds.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"This is a really great game, the weapons have all their unique perks. When I thought I wouldn't use a certain weapon I found ways that had great perks compared to to the others. Each weapon works better with certain boons compared to others and gives a whole new different play style. \\n\\nThe flow of combat is really awesome, with the wall bashing, pushing enemies into traps, deflecting their attacks, or even making debris fall on them. I loved dashing around with the  shield and ramming enemies into walls and lava. It was so satisfying just pushing them around into explosions or lava.\\n\\nThe story progression is really good as well, almost all the characters really feel for you and wanna help you which kind of in turn adds sympathy toward Zagreus, personally. The backstory is really intriguing the more it's uncovered. The more you die the more dialogue you uncover which is a nice touch.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that with the Titan Blood, being the hardest to get, I was really hoping for better upgrades. Especially the ones that cost two Titan Blood. There are maybe one or two upgrades that I actually liked. That is just my opinion and others may think otherwise.\\n\\nOverall I love this game a lot and would highly recommend it. I can't wait what they do next as they further update the game. I wish I could add more to this review because there is just so much that is great about it but I am really not good at reviews yet (this is actually my first one I believe). Sorry if this review was a bit shit :P\",\n",

       "    'review': \"The most polished early access game I've ever played. \\n\\nIf you're a fan of rogue-likes and action RPGs you're in for a real treat. The artwork is stunning and it runs flawlessly. The voice acting and adaptations of Greek mythological characters are really well done (seriously, there are endless snippets of well written dialogue) which leads to a surprising amount of character development (flavour). My favourite is Poseidon, what a bro. \\nThe gameplay is fantastic and incredibly satisfying. There's plenty in the way of weapon (ranged and melee) and build variety so each run is interesting, and the various permanent upgrades keep you motivated to get out and find more resources to trade. \\n\\nThe development team have a clear road map, make frequent large updates and have plenty more they want to add before the full release. I'd say it's more than worth your money now though, I can't believe this wasn't on my radar sooner!\",\n",

       "    'review': 'I highly recommend giving this masterpiece of a game a try. The visuals and art style are amazing, the writing is clever, funny and is really believable, and the music is just beautiful (exceptionally so for the songs sung by Orpheus and Eurydice). In addition to good looks and sounds, the gameplay is absolutely addicting and really hits that point of pure satisfaction that comes with rouge-likes. The best gameplay aspect though, has to be the way the weapons feel to use and how unique the whole experience feels, I\\'ve not once felt that I was simply \"going through the motions\" with combat or progression through levels and I\\'ve always felt challenged regardless of how well the run was going. TLDR: absolutely legendary PLAY IT NOW!',\n",

       "    'review': '作为一款还在EA的游戏，完成度已经非常高了，目前地图只有四章，但是足够玩很久了。\\n\\n优点：\\n1.爽！有手柄的游戏体验是远远高于键鼠的，动作流畅，非常爽快，尤其每次玩到后期各种恩赐加持的时候更爽。游戏虽然走的也是受苦路线，但是绝非黑魂一类的慢节奏，更像是鬼泣一类的爽快。\\n2.各种build随心组合，每次都有新花样。从目前的体验来看，每个神的恩赐都有侧重点且各不相同，每次重新开局因为恩赐的随机性都会玩出不同的花样，增加可玩性。\\n3.剧情有意思，对话不重样。故事主要讲的就是哈迪斯的儿子要离家出走，除了爹，所有亲戚都来帮他的故事……而且每次重新开局与所有人物的对话都不重样，让我深感制作组的用心，非常棒。\\n4.硬核但是不恶意，难度不小，但是完全没有恶意内容，你死了只因为你菜，而且死后用一种诙谐的手法让你从头再来，大大降低了类似同类游戏死亡的懊恼感。\\n\\n缺点：\\n1.因为关卡暂时不多，所以boss数量也偏少，虽然可以花式虐他们，但被他们虐的方式很单一，而且除了第三关boss和哈迪斯，前面两关的boss难度真心不够高。如果后面几关也类似第一关一样boss会随机切换就好了。\\n2.为啥没上成就系统？\\n3.不知道为什么最近玩了至少十几轮了，都没遇到大更新的冬季女神（之前有遇到），偃月刀也没了，更新内容只剩下钓鱼了，是bug吗？',\n",

       "    'review': \"[strike]It's okay I guess.[/strike]\\n\\nYou would not know this game was in early access if the devs didn't mark it as such. I know they've been working on it for a long time, but everything about this game is perfect. \\n\\nDisclaimer: I have never played a roguelike game before this one, and it sets the bar pretty high. It's only taken me so long to write a review because I was a little busy...\\n\\nThe artwork in this game is stunning. The colors, the environments, all of it is gorgeous. Darren Korb knocks it out of the park with the soundtrack once again. As he does with the voice acting, too! Each character has a fantastic actor behind them giving a stellar performance, and bro-Dionysus is one of my favorite gods. There's such life to each character, and the story wouldn't be the same without them. \\n\\nThe gameplay is so much fun. The variety of weapons and abilities creates limitless fighting styles and it is so exciting to play with different combos. Enemies are randomized across chambers and regions, but there are certain enemies that only appear in those regions (i.e. one specific type of ghost in region one, a different variation of the ghost in region two, etc) and the final bosses of the region are the same each time, with the same attacks and actions. Some may find this off-putting, but I like being able to learn their moves and kill them quickly instead of having new attacks I have to learn each time. \\n\\nThe little details in this game are enchanting. Certain rewards, cosmetic changes, and other smaller things help give this game another level of atmosphere that I adore. I simply can't recommend this game enough. A+++++, I've bought it for all my friends who put it on their wishlist because I want them to be able to experience it ASAP\",\n",

       "    'review': \"I've purchased this game almost randomly during the sale. It looked nice, had a roguelite tag, it's store page was filled with positive reviews - why not? I have never played a Supergiant game before. Now I will! \\n\\nHades is a roguelite with an excellent audio/visual presentation, memorable characters and smooth gameplay. It's variety is not as huge as some other games in the genre (like Binding of Isaac), but it makes it up in gameplay department. I've enjoyed it way more than similar games. Something here just makes combat feel way more... meaty? Also, unlike many bullet hell-ish games, the combat is a mix between melee and ranged. There are purely ranged and purely melee weapons, but on most runs you'll use both. \\n\\nThe story in this game is a little bit overrated, as at it's core it is quite simple. Still, characters are great and there are tons of dialogue lines, for a roguelite game at least. You can develop your relationships with characters you like, although many of those relationships are still WIP. And there are some clever jokes and references, but not to the point it becomes a parody.\\n\\nAnother thing different to many other roguelites would be amount of randomness you can control. You get to choose which weapon you want to start with, and also can influence the upgrades you'll get during the run. \\n\\nOne of the weaker points of the game might be it's replayability. It has decent amount of upgrades, currently 5 (soon 6) weapons, each of which can be modified in 1 of the 3 ways. There are plenty of crazy builds you can attempt to make. But boss, zone and enemy variety is a bit lacking. But hey, look at my playtime! All these hours I've had tons of fun.\",\n",

       "    'review': '优点：\\n·画面风格独特的rougelike，细腻，地图上的小细节也很丰富\\n·因为闪避可以打断动作，配合天赋甚至能增加闪避次数，所以游戏整体流畅度很高。用矛投掷天赋甚至能玩出复仇之矛的感觉！\\n·天赋的套路搭配很多，可肝的东西也比较有吸引力，所以重复游玩的乐趣不会下降的太快\\n·打击感音效配合手柄震动感觉很不错。手柄还会根据武器不同招式不同有相应的震动模式\\n·boss难度还行，对手残党还算友好，初见不熟悉技能会很懵圈，熟悉技能套路之后就相对简单。第二关boss九头蛇更新也降低了繁琐程度舒服很多。\\n·武器有不同形态\\n·地图上的机关很丰富\\n·伤害加成类型很多，比如陷阱，撞墙，死角。\\n\\n缺点：\\n·还有些对话没有汉化，虽然游戏还在测试阶段\\n·怪物种类还是略少，虽然游戏还在开发阶段\\n·流程比较短，但游戏更新速度还挺快，下次更新时间会早早告知，啊，这是优点了\\n·天赋比较看脸，要是恩赐刷的乱甚至不刷了，伤害会很低打起来会很难受，说的就是你一星卡戎弓！\\n·第一个刷的恩赐是随机固定的，不能通过进图放弃刷新，要么自裁，要么带回去戴定向配饰。\\n·自爆卡车在某些无击退效果的时候很不友好\\n·一旦玩熟了重复游玩性我觉得不是很高，一方面热度上的条款只是单单增加难度，对没有挑战欲的玩家来说可能会没啥意思，因为高难度所换来的奖励无非就是强化了一点武器形态，性价比太低。另一方面恩赐的种类还是有点少，每个种类的恩赐无非对应了几个按键加一些buff,debuff,恩赐之间的连携效果也没有很明显,食之无味弃之可惜。\\n\\n相比死亡细胞，故事性和流畅打击会更舒服，总的来说是个相当不错的rougelike游戏。\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'review': \"Se non avete voglia di leggere (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYat_479dA)\\n\\n\\nThe Binding of Isaac, Enter the gungeon, Dead Cells sono alcuni tra i migliori esempi del genere, ma dallo scorso dicembre possiamo aggiungere Hades all'albo d'oro dei Roguelike.\\n\\nSviluppato e pubblicato da quei ragazzacci della Supergiant Games, team californiano con alle spalle pietre miliari del carico di Transistor, Pyre e Bastion, questo Hades ci catapulta nella mitologia greca mettendoci nei panni di zagreus, principe degli inferi.\\n\\nAnnoiato dalla vita monotona e recluso nel Tartaro del padre Ade, Zagreus cerca costantemente di abbandonare la dimora di famiglia e ascendere al mondo dei vivi.\\n\\nContrariamente a quanto succede nella gran parte dei roguelike, Hades ci circonda con un mondo vivo e in continua evoluzione. \\nLa dimora di Ade è infatti invasa da entità mitiche con le quali possiamo interagire. \\n\\nStringere rapporti con loro è più importante di quanto possa sembrare dopo le prime run, infatti, insistendo, sbloccheremo non solo nuove scelte di dialogo che andranno ad approfondire la lore del titolo, ma riceveremo anche dei doni che andranno a potenziarci durante i nostri tentativi di fuga.\\n\\nMalgrado l'ambientazione, gli sviluppatori hanno deciso di raccontarci un Aldilà molto POP. Ogni volta che verremo sconfitti, rinasceremo al cospetto di nostro padre e verremo puntualmente sbeffeggiati dagli npc sopracitati, evidenziando non solo l'impossibilità dell'impresa, ma anche trattandoci da adolescenti cocciuti che prima poi cominceranno a fare gli uomini.\\n\\nPrima di cominciare ogni tentativo di fuga faremo puntualmente tappa nella nostra stanza e nell'armeria.\\n\\nLa camera, elegante e ricca di dettagli, nasconde lo specchio della notte, regalatoci dalla nostra matrigna Nyx, esso ci permette di attivare alcuni bonus mediante l'utilizzo delle chiavi che troveremo sparse per gli inferi.\\n\\nL'armeria, immediatamente adiacente alla Camera, ci da la possibilità di provare tutte le armi che abbiamo al momento,  visualizzando i danni che rechiamo e provare eventuali combo. Oltre alle armi è presente anche un armadietto con tutti i regali che gli npc ci hanno fatto, possiamo equipaggiarli e nel menù possiamo vederne le caratteristiche e le condizioni per poterli migliorare.\\n\\nScelto il nostro setup possiamo lanciarci nella mischia. Il gameplay è rapido e immediato, abbiamo a disposizione due attacchi differenti per ogni arma, rispettivamente sul click sinistro e sul tasto Q, mentre con il tasto destro lanciamo uno shard su un nemico abbassando le sue difese. \\n\\nI nemici saranno tanti, attaccheranno in massa e modi diversi, e tra un colpo e una schivata dovremmo anche stare attenti alle trappole presenti nelle stanze, e, come ogni Roguelike che si rispetti, più andremo avanti peggio sarà, i nemici si faranno sempre più numerosi e ogni piano presenterà lo stesso bastardissimo boss finale.\\n\\nDetta cosi l'impresa risulta davvero impossibile ma fino ad ora non abbiamo ancora parlato dei classici powerup presenti in ogni Roguelike che si rispetti.\\n\\nLa nostra spedizione infatti sarà supportata da tutti gli altri dei dell'olimpo che ci lasceranno, sparsi nella mappa, alcune benedizioni.\\n\\nQueste funzionano in maniera piuttosto diversa da come siamo abituati, una volta raccolte, dopo un breve dialogo che andrà ad approfondire l'affinità verso quella divinità, potremmo scegliere cosa il potenziamento andrà a migliorare e a seconda della qualità e del tipo di bonus potremmo assegnare degli effetti extra alle nostre abilità.\\n\\nOgni divinità avrà una sorta di scala evolutiva tutta sua, Zeus, ad esempio, ci permetterà di sparare saette con i nostri attacchi ed ogni qualvolta avremo accesso ad una sua benedizione, esso punterà ad aumentarne l'efficacia o magari ci permetterà di farceli generare da altre fonti, come la schivata o il lancio sul tasto destro. \\nPer questo motivo,  in vista di una creazione di una qualsivoglia build, vi consigliamo di concentrarvi sulla stessa divinità, a meno che non siete alla ricerca di uno specifico potenziamento, ma attenzione, non sono sempre uguali e soprattutto hanno una rarità.\\n\\n\\nIl mondo di gioco è incredibile. Il tartaro viene raffigurato come un immenso labirinto, la struttura delle stanze è spesso diversa e tra trappole ed eventi casuali la nostra esplorazione risulterà ogni volta una nuova sfida, è che sfida!\\n\\nPer quanto il genere risulti ormai ampiamente esplorato, questo Hades sarà capace senza dubbio di stupirvi. Le possibilità di crescita sono infinite e per quanto riuscirete a sentirvi forti e preparati il livello di sfida si impennerà sempre, sono un amante dei Roguelike lo sapete e se adesso ho voglia di spararmi un run in qualcosa, state certi che la mia scelta ricadrà su Hades.\",\n",

By the time I unlocked one I'd already established a style of play and I am constantly forgetting to use them. I suspect allowing one at least to be available earlier would have better fit it into my play cycles and taught me to use them better... but that's a minor complaint.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'This might be early access but it definitely doesn\\'t feel like it, I have yet to encounter a bug and no part of the game progress feels unfinished, it seems like the devs have taken the good approach of completely finishing a feature before releasing it which is a really nice refresher given the usual nature of early access games.\\n\\nNow when it comes to the game itself I am pretty amazed. I do enjoy roguelites but typically I get bored of them relatively quickly because there isn\\'t much to push for except \"I hope I make it past X amount of levels this time\". This original approach of incorporating an actual narrative in a way that makes sense with the core roguelite concept (which is really just to try the same randomised dungeon over and over again) really gives this little extra incentive to keep playing since you don\\'t just grind for levels and gear but also for the story. Hence, I have never felt a stronger feeling of \"just one more run\" in any roguelite I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nGraphically the screenshots speak for themselves. The voice acting is on point, giving each character a clear personality. The music is intense and makes fights that much enjoyable, not that it really needed it because the gameplay is really solid.\\n\\nThe fights are fast paced and the various boons/upgrades you can collect (and combine) from the different gods do make you play the game in slightly different ways every run and the different weapons each require a completely different approach to your fighting style. Worth mentioning also that every weapon eventually can be transformed into variations of itself; although those variations are pretty much another layer god boons.\\n\\nThe only little thing I regret so far is that the character upgrade system feels a bit...bland? you don\\'t really unlock new abilities and most of the upgrades are passive bonuses such as +5HP, +10gold, +1% of having X happen which feels a tad boring although the devs did mention working on some changes so we\\'ll see.\\n\\nBut overall this is a solid game even in its early access state that I can only recommend.\\n',\n",

The linear story progresses as you complete more runs and keep talking to NPCs, who have dialog to react to things that happen on the runs including when you beat the crap out of them during said runs. Honestly, I can\\'t even imagine the sheer amount of voice acting that went into this game...give me like 50 more hours of gameplay to estimate.\\n\\nCombat is excellent too, and you\\'re forced to adapt your strategy and style based on the buffs and mods you get during runs.\\n\\n10/10 Goodboy Pets, Who\\'s a goodboy??',\n",

       "    'review': \"Fast paced, Action Rogue-lite. There are not many games that capture this high speed action with random boons or perks that can vastly change each run. Death is a chance to grow stronger and go further. The weapon's are all unique and change up the gameplay in their own right. There is another weapon yet to come I'm looking forward to seeing! There is an element of RNG in perk selections, but skill can not be understated.  The lategame is setup brilliantly for an increasing challenge. This game does a great job of making you feel incredibly powerful, dare I say, godlike. And still find yourself crawling out of the Pool of Styx. Definitely a game you should try. I hope to see them put in more Gods and boons. The Long Winter was a great addition and makes me want more!\",\n",

       "    'review': \"I won't stop recommending this game to my friends until they play it. If anyone on my friends list sees this review - play this game. It's in early access but the amount of content already there is incredible.\\n\\nI played around 50 runs in about a week and I'm not stopping there. The recency bias has long disappeared and I still love this game. Within the first 10 hours I added it to my favorites category and it will always have a place in my heart as one of my favorite games. \\n\\nThe lore is amazing, it gives a great twist on Greek Mythology while still being informative and entertaining. I got really invested into the characters and became interested in raising my affection with them after a while. They were exciting to talk to and I was willing to put a pause on my game play to listen to their amazing voice lines. \\n\\nThe combat is amazingly snappy and satisfying, packing punch behind every hit with almost every weapon. The bow I believe could use some work as it feels clunky, slow and the aspects are lackluster compared to other weapons aspects. I love how many options there are for damaging enemies: attacks, dashes, dash-attacks, charge-attacks, special-attacks, casts and calls are all divine to use. The synergies for all of these are functional and what you would expect, rarely breaking. Knock-back, chain-lightning, hangover, doom and deflection synergies are thrilling and dynamic in their game design while the stat-effect synergy weakness is less appealing. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is detailed and while sometimes overwhelming, eventually becomes more easily parsed, allowing for better play and less moments of confusion over taking damage. A nice touch that would help atmosphere wise would be to see the green aesthetic shades appear in a room after clearing the hostile shades in Tartarus. For Asphodel, my casts sometimes get lost in the bending and shadowed walls beyond the lava shores, making it annoying to interrupt the game play loop to increase overall damage output. In Elysium, the wall spear traps have divots that cause the player to get stuck between them, taking continual damage. This has happened less as I learned to stay away from the walls in Elysium, however, it interrupted the game play loop many times and was an overall frustrating addition.\\n\\nI can visualize this game becoming a sensation and defining title among the rogue-like genre; If Hades continues adding new content and possibly more replay-ability in alternate path(s), compelling endings and delicious synergies, it will definitely become a classic I will return to for years and years.\\n\\n[table]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th][b]Category[/b][/th]\\n        [th][b]Rating[/b][/th]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Combat[/td]\\n        [td]9/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Lore[/td]\\n        [td]8/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Atmosphere[/td]\\n        [td]7/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Performance[/td]\\n        [td]10/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table]\",\n",

It took me a long time to get to the end and even after I have enjoyed every run to further make myself stronger for future content. I am STILL working to get everything maxed. \\n\\nI also want to give a special shout out to Darren Korb. He\\'s the guy who made the majority of the music. I very much appreciate the entire sound track. I find myself to regularly having the song \"Good Riddance\" in my head and appreciate the emotion behind the \"Lament of Orpheus\". All of the other songs...I wish I had more bass in my head phones to really rock out to it.',\n",

The characters you meet are plenty and unique, the story, albeit unfinished is engaging and the combat is a goddamn pleasure.\\n\\nWhat I particularly enjoy is the very meaningful character progression. You can improve yourself between each game, you can also customize your weapons and eventually add conditions to make the game more challenging and earn better rewards. I also like the way you gather godly boons during a game which can lead to amazing combos and completely change the way you play between two games. It makes each game feel fresh and unique.\\n\\nIt's in early access, regularly updated and already extremely solid. I wholeheartedly recommand it.\",\n",

Rogue likes in general are my favorite genre besides RPG's, I only sank 14.4 hours into this game but I did not leave because I was tired. This game is one I want to see succeed because it is genuinely an amazing game and so much fun to play, I did not want to review it when I came in. \\n\\nInstead I'd rather wait till now when a major update came out not too long ago that added bunches of more hours and more ways to play the game. If you want something to sink some time into that's fun and not multiplayer this is your game, and I highly recommend you check this out.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Gets boring pretty fast. I haven\\'t played many roguelikes, but I expected a bit more variety in enemies, rooms and \"viable\" power ups. Yes, there\\'s almost infinite possibilities for combining boons from different gods, but a lot of those combos aren\\'t really good, so you\\'re always hoping for a few boons and upgrades to show up every run.\\n\\nThe game is also kind of easy and although you can increase the difficulty via a few mechanics, it\\'s still very boring to keep repeating the same thing with tiny differences each time. I think it\\'s a good game if you enjoy grinding endlessly and aren\\'t really bothered by SLOWLY getting stronger while fighting the same enemies every 10 to 30 minutes. The story is cool, but also irrelevant (you can probably skip every dialogue and still understand the game just fine).\\n\\nAll in all, I find it hard to justify going back to the game at this point and even \"major\" updates haven\\'t improved that feeling by more than a couple runs for me. Maybe I\\'m just not the target audience for roguelike games, so if you really enjoy those and have dozens (maybe hundreds) of hours to spare, I imagine this would be a pretty good game for you.',\n",

       "    'review': \"Fantastic game, tons of replayability, 130+ hours in, and still not tired of the game. Each run can be wildly different based on your luck, and the game is in a pretty good state despite the early access tag. Game play is highly polished, and could easily pass as a fully developed game. Hell, even better than some fully developed games. The game don't feel overly hard, and feels like its in a good state of balance right now. As you play you'll get better at the game and a basic run is simply a breeze after awhile, between the upgrades and the player getting better. But that doesn't make the game boring as you can scale up the difficulty, which makes the game even more satisfying when you clear a high difficulty run, after dozens of attempts.\\n\\nThe dialogs in the game is deep and characters have great developments. At the end of each run, heading back to the house is a treat of itself. Despite spending so much time on the game, there's still some dialogs with the NPCs that surprised me, speaks volume of how much effort was put into the game. With each major update, not only are there some game play changes, there's even updates to the NPCs interaction that just absolutely delightful.\\n\\nThe developers is always listening to the community feedback, and is constantly improving the game. Can't wait for the next major update that's gonna add a lot more contents.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"This game is insane!! It's in early access, but it's more finished and polished than a lot of other games coming out with their full (or fully broken) release.\\n\\nI have longed for a hack&slash with a combat system like this. Although Hades isn't a traditional hack&slash, I don't know why it cannot fall into that category, at least in a broader sense: you crawl through a dungeon and kill monsters over and over. Except with a different concept, you don't find items but buffs instead. And instead of creating a new character to experience a new fighting style, in Hades you simply start a new run and everything is different and you adapt on the way. The focus is also on your fighting, not gear or skilltree.\\n\\nThe story isn't forced on you or given to you on a silver platter. You can engage in it by talking with NPCs and you get their perspective on things (everytime you die and take a break from fighting). Which makes it highly believable and intriguing.\\n\\nI had a ton of fun. Money well spent. Refund your WC3 Reforged and get this instead, you'll end up being happier.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Hades is easily one of the most fun games I\\'ve played in the last few years, and it\\'s not even done yet! The chamber-to-chamber movement, with a reward after each encounter, keeps the gameplay loop fresh and exciting even after you\\'ve been playing for hours. Combat leans toward fast-paced, dodge-intensive fights, but you can also get options to play safer and whittle down enemies if that\\'s how you prefer to play. In fact, I think what I love so much about Hades is that there doesn\\'t seem to be a lot of \"bad\" choices or builds; with practice and patience you can probably finish the game with just about any combination of weapon, boons, and trinket. The boons(upgrades that are lost if you die) all have a place and a situation where you\\'ll say \"Yeah, I can use that,\" and as you gain permanent upgrades that increase your boons\\' rarity(which affects the boon\\'s base power and allows access to more effects) and items that let you manipulate which god will give you their boon first, you can create more consistent runs with a more specific set of boons, or you can keep leaving everything to chance to keep to the roguelike spirit of the game. You will get destroyed on your first few runs, but once you get the hang of it, earn some upgrades, and make some offerings to your favorite characters, you\\'ll be hooked. \\n\\nWith a Supergiant game, it\\'s maybe unnecessary to point out the game delivers just as much on aesthetics as on gameplay. The Underworld is colorful and beautiful without compromising on being literal hell, the character designs are excellent, and the soundtrack by Darren Korb is fire. Even if you don\\'t end up playing Hades, the soundtrack is on Spotify and Youtube and is well worth a listen. \\n\\nFinally, the writing of the game is really good. You play as Zagreus, the son of Hades, the god of the Greek afterlife, and between dying painfully to traps and monsters scattered throughout the underworld, you have chances to talk to figures from Greek mythology like Achilles, Orpheus, and Cerberus(yes, you *can* pet the dog). You\\'ll learn more about each character over time, as well as uncover more about why exactly Zagreus is willing to risk his life over and over to escape Hades, and what has the gods on Olympus so interested in helping him break out. The story is not finished at the time of writing this review; but I\\'m very interested in seeing what happens in future updates.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be hard-pressed to find another Early Access game that feels, looks, and sounds as good as Hades. Buy it. 10/10\\n',\n",

       "    'review': \"Encore un excellent jeu de la part de SuperGiant Games. Un rogue-like (ou rogue-lite ?) très plaisant à jouer et qui donne toujours envie de retenter une run, dans la lignée de The Binding of Isaac ou Enter The Gungeon. L'univers et les personnages sont bien développés et très intéressants à découvrir, la BO colle parfaitement à l'ambiance du titre et le contenu est déjà assez conséquent, surtout que le jeu est encore en Early Access. Malgré quelques petits soucis par ci par là (certaines répliques qui passent soudainement en anglais et une ou deux baisses de framerate), le jeu reste extrêmement agréable à jouer, et on a vraiment un sentiment de progression, renforcé par le fait que l'histoire s'étoffe au fur et à mesure que l'on parvient à aller de plus en plus loin dans le royaume des morts. Le seul défaut assez conséquent serait le grind, qui peut paraître parfois assez fastidieux, mais rien qui ne nuise réellement à l'expérience de jeu selon moi.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"Hades is the next masterpiece crafted by SuperGiant Games.\\n\\nAgain, they deliver through action, visuals, storytelling and music. All of it is great. The mechanics are interesting and offer what is for me an addictive rogue-like type gameplay. Usually I am not that much of a fan of rogue-likes and I tend to lose interest because it doesn't feel like there is real progression. But with Hades... You really get this feeling of: *just one more try*. Or you wanna try something new or different on your next run. There is many ways to play this game and approach your playstyle. Plus, the game offers more than just repetitive runs. There are other characters that are interesting to get to know, and each have something to offer.\\n\\nSome might say that the story is not as strong as their other games', as it is not completely original like before but based on greek mythology. Sure, but I feel like this lets them focus more of the game itself; and the game IS a whole lot fun. Besides, the story is still fun and interesting enough to keep your interests peaked.\\n\\nIn short: if you like SuperGiant's previous games, than this is your next buy. Into rogue-likes or (isometric) action games? Definitely worth a buy.\",\n",

Artwork, sound effects, responsive gameplay, characters, voice acting, oh my god the soundtracks all on point. Darren Korb is a magician. It would say Hades gone far and beyond even though the previous titles were already set a very high bar. It has insane replayability and even when you keep resetting you feel like you are progressing at just the right amount. \\n\\nHades feels incredibly responsive. Soundtracks are amazing as usual. As of Feb 2020 in the state of early access game has more content than most of the games released and had a couple of DLCs over the years. In the gloom days of gaming clouded by Bethesda, EA, etc, Supergiant is a gem. Enjoy what they have to offer to the fullest.\",\n",

What\\'s interesting is that the narrative that has been woven into the core gameplay look is nice.  The characters understand that, \"Hey.  I know we keep doing this over an over, but I\\'m going to try to kill you again anyway.  Okay?  Great!\" Oh, and the voice acting really adds that special something.',\n",

Then again, this being from the same developers who made Transistor & Bastion, I shouldn't be that surprised.\\n\\nAs an action/rogue game, it has so much replay value and it's not even finished. Sure, there are some balancing issues with boons (buffs) right now, but I have faith that the developer will be working to make each one worthwhile in some build style. My only real complaint is that Athena's Divine Dash boon is almost mandatory to beat the existing game.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"What can I say about Hades? Pretty much the same thing I can say about all the other SuperGiant Games I've played. The controls are tighter than a formula one car, the visuals and art style are incredible as always, the characters are deep with superb voice acting and its the most fun action based rogue-like I've played. The only complaint I could make about this game is that there is A LOT of clicking and WASD manipulation, which for some of us older gamers with worn out joints means sometimes extended play sessions can cause some pain. But damn do I not even notice it most of the time, since I'm having so much fun. This is the most polished early access title I've played. Zero Crashes, I haven't found any bugs or encountered any errors. I cant wait to see what additional content lies ahead for Hades. ITS A HELL OF A GOOD TIME!\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Wow! what a game! where to begin... I was thinking about buying Wolcen and in the near future i will probably buy that game still but this Gem just came out of nowhere for me. Hell i dont even like Roguelike/lite that much and after 1 hour in i already knew this was something special. I dont wanna spoil anything but let me tell you this. \\n\\n* Impressive art style that fits in every pixel of your screen. Its lovely, its distinct and its gorgeous\\n* Combat feels something like Diablo or twin stick shooters from back in the day but everything here is more fluid. every button press is instant\\n* The game has great voiceovers (all interactions are voiceovers wich is impressive because the immersion is off the chart in this game)\\n* Great RPG elements that has different rarity and a unique playstyle for most of the runs u do, \\n* Just great systems that work in a clever manor choosing between Reward or convenience. Gold or Life. \\n\\nI can write for hours because this game made me realise how much i miss the surprise factor that almost no Triple A games give these days. For me this game is a solid 9.5/10 and i hope to see lots of more content in the near future! \\n\\nLove from The Netherlands',\n",

Музыка, атмосфера, дизайн уровней на высшем уровне, погружаешься в каждый из миров целиком и полностью, Hades, конечно, еще в раннем доступе, но уже есть чем заняться, да и тематика мифологии Древней Греции очень импонирует. \\nГГ узнает, что Персефона является его родной матерью, а не Нюкта, как ему внушали все эти годы, и пытается сбежать из царства своего отца Аида, который не намерен так просто отпускать своего буйного сына. Олимпийцы с удовольствием готовы принять своего племянника, и сам Хаос на стороне главного героя, но все они почти бессильны на вотчине Аида. Загрею предстоит тяжелый путь наверх... и вам.',\n",

Aber es ist kein gutes Supergiant Spiel.\\n\\nOder anders, [b]für mich haben sich Supergiant Spiele bisher immer durch eine ausgezeichnete Mischung aus Story und Gameplay ausgezeichnet[/b]. \\n\\nHades aber geht einen anderen Weg: [b]es stellt das Gameplay vorne an und ordnet die Story diesem fast vollständig unter[/b].\\n\\nDabei entsteht dann ein Spiel, dass zwar viel Spaß zum spielen macht, aber keine emotionale oder gar mitreißende Story erzählt. Noch schlimmer, weil man im Vergleich zum erleben der Story einen überwältigenden Anteil der Zeit mit nicht story-relevanten Kämpfen verbringt, geraten die nach wie vor gut geschriebenen Texte noch weiter in den Hintergrund. Dabei hilft es dann leider auch nicht, dass die Vertonung gut ist.\\n\\nEbenfalls nicht so gut wie bei Bastion, Transistor und Pyre finde ich den Soundtrack: weniger markant, weniger abwechslungsreich, weniger tolle Vocals.\\n\\nDann merkt man leider auch, dass die Entwickler hier Elemente aus z.B. Bastion recycling: von Gegner-Designs, über Animationen und Gameplay-Details. Hades ist ein behutsames Update von dem, was schon Bastion geboten hat, minus der Story.\\n\\nJa, das Spiel ist noch nicht fertig und dafür hat es schon durchaus eine zufriedenstellende Menge an Content. Dennoch zweifle ich daran, dass man noch eine Story auf dem Niveau eines Pyre oder Transistor erzählen wird.\\n\\n\\n[b]Fazit:[/b] wer das Spiel vor allem wegen dem Gameplay kauft, der kann hier absolut bedenkenlos zuschlagen. Wer aber Story, Charaktere und Emotionen erwartet, der wird enttäuscht werden und schaut sich besser etwas anderes an.\\n\\n\\nPS: wenn das Spiel fertig ist, werde ich es noch mal spielen. Bis dahin aber habe ich nach einem Durchlauf erst mal genug.',\n",

       "    'review': \"the good: This game is absolutely incredible. It takes the experimentation and near infinite build possibilities of other rogue-likes and combines it with a solid narrative and great characters, as well as an ever-evolving story as you learn more and more about the world. Currently 5 weapons (soon to be 6 apparently) with several forms of each, as well as countless different upgrades you can take each run based on what god you speak to. Build possibilities are nearly endless, combat is fluid, fast paced, and satisfying, art is incredible and stunning. \\nthe bad: Obviously it's in early access, and while the game is fantastically well polished, there ARE some bugs here and there that might annoy you. Not to mention some things are still being balanced, so don't expect all builds to be viable. There's no graphics options other than resolution, and while the game IS easy to run, I question how any game in 2020 could have no graphics options on PC. Finally, some of the in game economies still need some balancing, the big one being Titan Blood, which you need to upgrade weapons and unlock new forms. I HIGHLY suggest getting a mod to reduce upgrade costs.\\n\\nOverall, this game is absolutely amazing, and well worth what's being asked for it. If you like games like Dead Cells or Binding of Isaac, I strongly suggest you give this game a shot.\",\n",

At the same time, this is the most fun I have had in absolute years. I love the sass, the bright colors, the absolutely chaotic fighting. I love bashing things in the face with a shield that looks like an eye. I love dashing over lava over jumpy-butt motherhumpers. I love collecting gems so I can hang a portrait of Aphrodite in my bedroom like some kind of weirdo. I just absolutely love this game. I don't care if I ever win. I just want to run around like some meth-addicted psycho with a shield.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'After ~40 hours I can say Hades is definitely a game worth buying If you\\'re a fan of roguelikes and/or Supergiant games in general.\\n\\nWhile the game is still in Early Access, Hades itself offers a good amount of content already. The combat is very addicting, with 4 weapons to choose from. Each weapon has up to 4 \"aspects\" you can equip (as of the Long winter update, the spear is the only one with 4 aspects), which change the gameplay loop significantly and offer a variety of  choices on how to approach. \\nBoons from the gods, which help the young prince Zagreus  escape from this hell, change how you tackle your current attempt as escaping. \\nMaybe you prefer the mighty zeus and his lightning-chain based attacks? Or you enjoy raining down big numbers through the crit-based boons of the goddess of the hunt, artemis? The choice is up to you.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is a treat to enjoy, and in my opinion the biggest enjoyment are the characters itself: Each character - from the inhabitants of the House of hades, the bosses or the gods of olympus - have a variety of dialogue, referring to one other or even talking amongst them.\\n\\nA TL;DR Version: I highly recommend playing it due to the following reasons: \\n\\nAmazing gameplay loop\\nWide Variety of choices (Weapon upgrades, boons, aspects, keepsakes)\\nAmazing soundtrack\\nChallenging Bossfights\\nAdjustable difficulty through the Pacts of Punishment (Available after clearing the final boss the first time)\\n\\nOh and also: You can pet the dog.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'review': \"This game isn't finished as of yet. And it's absolutely wonderful. I'm a fan of games like this where each run has so much variety. I enjoy being able to swap between all the weapons which adds quite a bit of variety in playstyle, I like the weapon upgrades per run that also make each run different as you try to mix and match synergistic combinations. Runs don't get stale gameplay-wise as they inevitably change as you get buffs and weapon upgrades each run which alter how you try to deal your damage to enemies and avoid their strikes. \\n\\nI like the heat mechanic added in after finally making it out the first time as well. Adds so much more replayability as you can to choose how the game gets even tougher! The upgrades all feel meaningful and effective both inside and outside of runs. I can't wait for this game to get even more content! Definitely incredibly fun for anyone who enjoys this genre and likes fast paced action. \\n\\nDid i mention that it's awesome to be able to pause the game? It's great to be able to pause the game and leave it open for any amount of time. I've come back 2 days later to finish a run I was in the middle of before because I got busy. Just a really nice quality of life thing, doesn't take up much cpu or anything either. I can leave it paused and play other graphically intense games with no issues on my laptop. \\n\\nAlso, Cerberus is the goodest doggo.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"If you're a fan of rogue-lites, Greek mythology (with a few embellishments), and an interesting story embedded in crazy combat, then you should absolutely pick this up. As others have said it honestly feels like a full release game despite being in early access, and dying and losing your progress through the levels is not near as frustrating here as I've found it in other games. The art design is outstanding (though this isn't too much a surprise considering the great work that's been done in the developer's other games, such as Transistor) and the attention to detail is outstanding. In addition some elements that are a bit less rewarding (such as Darkness, a form of currency to level up your character between runs) are being actively worked on along with further content being added--and every dialogue line is voiced! I've rarely seen that in high-budget triple A titles, nevertheless something from a smaller developer. Now that this is available on Steam (rather than exclusive to another platform...) I would absolutely recommend this.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Ce jeu impose un sacré record pour moi : Celui de prouver que c\\'est un bon jeu en moins de 2 minutes !\\nIl a le gameplay, les graphismes, le contenu et l\\'histoire !\\n\\nC\\'est assez dingue à constater d\\'ailleurs ! Je l\\'ai acheté ce matin et y ai joué 7 heures d\\'affilés. \\n\\nNe serait-ce que le menu est carrément bien fait ! C\\'est fou ! L\\'OST magnifique, tout est soigné ! Il y a énormément de dialogues, jamais les mêmes. Le contenu des dialogues est très mure.\\nOn incarne un jeune homme, fils d\\'Hades et papa ne nous aime pas trop .. Il n\\'oublie jamais de nous le faire remarquer d\\'ailleur : \\n\"C\\'est à cause de toi que cerbère à détruit le salon, parceque tu ne t\\'en occupe pas bien.\", \"Ils me refusent même l\\'installation d\\'un cadrant solaire, à cause de l\\'ombre que tu portes à la famille.\" ( Ce ne sont pas les paroles exact, mais ce qu\\'elles expriment y est.). \\nJ\\'apprécie vraiment d\\'avoir de vrais personnages, avec une personnalité authentique, un caractère propre, une identité qui manque à beaucoup d\\'autres jeu.\\n\\nEt le gameplay, olalala ... C\\'est un vraie tuerie !  ça faisait longtemps que des combats ne m\\'avaient pas autant fait plaisir ! Esquive, combo d\\'attaque, attaque spéciale 1 et 2 sont nos seules touches de combats et c\\'est laaaargement suffisant ! La tension est élevée pendant les combats, c\\'est dynamique, nerveux, c\\'est beau, ça frappe fort .. On sent clairement l\\'impact de nos coup et les effets sont carrément magnifique. Le monde vivant n\\'oublie pas les épreuves qu\\'on a traversé et il évolue lui aussi, d\\'une manière remarquablement propre et cohérente d\\'ailleurs.\\n\\nSelon moi, Hades est clairement un produit haut de gamme pour un prix vraiment raisonnable. Je ne connais pas la taille du studio qui bosse dessus mais ils n\\'ont pas à être jaloux de ce qu\\'il se fait à cotés, bien au contraire. \\nBref, un chef-d\\'oeuvre !\\n\\nAller, quelques points que j\\'aurai bien aimé avoir :\\n-Un RNG plus équilibré\\n-Un mode multi\\n\\nNote : J\\'ai vu le jeu sur EG avant qu\\'il sorte sur steam et .. Je sais pas trop, je le sentais pas. Ce n\\'est qu\\'en voyant le nombre impressionnant de bonnes critiques steam que j\\'ai décidé de l\\'acheter. Je ne suis clairement pas déçu. Le système de review de steam est vraiment une bonne chose pour les jeux qui méritent !',\n",

       "    'review': 'Wonderful game! Can\\'t wait to see what it\\'s like on full release.\\n\\nCombat is tight and fun, enemies seem fair and balanced for the most part. Most bosses feel completely OP when you first fight them but the more you fight them the more you see their patterns and realize what you need to do. My one complaint would be the artifacts seem poorly balanced, The artifact that gives a percentage of health back when picking up Darkness seems very strong (a good thing) but most of the others don\\'t seem all that useful. I only have about half of the Artifacts unlocked so some of those may be strong as well. Haven\\'t completed a full run yet so that also may change things.\\n\\nThe perk that gives 10% damage when your cast is in the enemy is a game changer, level that one up as early as you can.\\n\\nOverall a wonderful game! I\\'ve spent most of my time since I purchased it playing, has been stealing time away from my other games. Even after a bad run if I decide to take a break I\\'ll usually go watch a video to get some ideas to beat whatever I\\'m stuck at and that will make me immediately want to play more. Definitely a \"one more run\" game.\\n\\nI was concerned that there wouldn\\'t be enough content when I purchased it but I would personally view this as a complete game if no one told me otherwise. Ready to see some more of the weapons they\\'re adding to the game!',\n",

       "    'review': 'Alles an diesem Spiel macht Riesenspaß. Unholde, Untote und andere Wächter der Unterwelt abmurksen natürlich, aber auch die Rahmenhandlung kann sich sehen lassen. Sie bedient sich mit Genuss an allen Gestalten der griechischen Sagenwelt, die nicht rechtzeitig die Bäume hochgekommen sind.\\n\\nRoguelike-Fans gegenüber muss klargestellt sein, dass dieses Spiel das exakte Gegenteil des Permadeath-Konzeptes verfolgt. Zagreus, Sohn des Hades, [b]kann[/b] gar nicht sterben. Er ist schließlich ein Gott, und Götter sind unsterblich. Das funktioniert wunderbar für dieses Spiel und die Rahmenhandlung. Ich kann auch gut verstehen, dass die Entwickler wohl kaum freiwillig auf das Wort \"Rogue-like\" fürs Marketing verzichten würden.\\n\\nAlle anderen sollten sich auch bewusst sein, dass die Handlung des Spiels unvollständig ist. Der letzte Akt fehlt... oder vielleicht sogar noch mehr Akte, die danach kommen, so genau kann man das nicht wissen. Je nachdem, wie wichtig euch also ganz speziell die Handlung ist, kann es sich lohnen, bis zum Release zu warten. Das Gameplay selbst ist absolut komplett und großartig.\\n\\nHades ist ein brilliantes Hack\\'n Slash Action RPG. Fans der Diablo-Reihe sollten absolut auf ihre Kosten kommen. Es ist kein Roguelike, aber ein Spiel muss nicht Roguelike sein, um gut zu sein.',\n",

With Bastion I had issues with replay ability, but with Hades game it's so easy to say just one more run. I'm not great at rouge likes, but Hades has story progress even when you get a bad run which keeps me engaged for hours. I highly recommend. I can't wait for the full release.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"It is an extremely good game that is seeing a lot of additions that keep on making the game more enjoyable. If you like Greek mythology and you enjoy story in your Roguelike, this is a great fit. Albeit, you don't need to read/listen to any of the dialogue, which makes it fit both bills. Every line in the game has dialogue to it (I think), which makes the game even more enjoyable to me. Although, it is in early access, so the amount of endgame content that doesn't include doing the same few levels is not there yet. I am looking forward to future updates to this game, which will hopefully include more gods/goddesses, new enemies/levels, and more content in the endgame.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Najlepsza gra rogue-like dungeon crawler na rynku. Prawdopodobnie lepszy jest tylko Dead Cells, który jest rogue-like metroidvanią. \\nBardzo dobry voice acting, gra która wciąga w swój świat i fabułę, Postacie, których nie da się nie lubić, każda ma w sobie coś charakterystycznego i naprawdę wiele możliwości buildów, alternatywnych zagrań oraz poziomu trudności możliwego w regulowaniu aż do stopnia przewyższającego souls-like gry. \\nJedyną wadą na ten moment jest całkiem mimo wszystko wysoka powtarzalność, brakuje większej różnorodności co do broni jak i samego rozwoju dungeonów w ciągu rozgrywki. W pewnym momencie każdy run, mimo losowości i nadanych przez nas zmian, jest mniej więcej podobny/taki sam w swej podstawie. Jest to zarazem też główna różnica, która sprawia, że takowy Dead Cells już nie mówiąc o legendarnym The Binding of Isaac, prezentuje się na dłuższą metę po prostu ciekawiej, a na pewno bardziej pochłania z czasem, mimo, że nie nadają aż takiej immersji jak Hades.  \\nTrudno jednak zarzucić grze jakiekolwiek wady w innych aspektach, jest cholernie dynamiczna i wykonana z największą dbałością, jeśli weźmiemy jeszcze pod uwagę fakt, że to wciąż early access i wiele rzeczy może być nadal zmienione i ulepszone to napawa mnie tylko optymizmem ku myśli, że nie jest to gra mająca na ten moment godnych konkurentów prócz jednej/dwóch wymienionych wcześniej. \\nPolecam każdemu, nie tylko osobom, które lubią ten typ rozgrywki, ale także osobom, które chcą może zaryzykować w ten gatunek i spróbować czegoś nowego.',\n",

       "    'review': '真的是我玩过打斗最爽的Roguelike类游戏了，非常喜欢这款的画风和背景，神作无疑了，希望越来越多玩家加入进来。\\n吐槽一下：\\n1.混沌之神是不是应该有一些更强的恩赐，毕竟是需要付出21血换来的恩赐，应该比其他神明恩赐更有特殊点\\n2.牛头人竞技场的柱子是不是模型还是不够完善，为什么有的时候半个身子进去了都撞不上，有时候就蹭了一下就能撞上？？？（的确不是我电脑的问题）\\n3.打完boss的那个卖恩赐的界面，希望能全部列出来，本来想存钱一路都是躲着商店的，结果boss房前面硬是就一个商店的时候还不能留着钱，如果打完boss想买口血没钱就得卖恩赐，但是随机抽三个很重要的或是高等级的，也不忍心卖，感觉就一点用都没有，还反倒有些搞心态。\\n4.那个美杜莎的装备啊，这个4%4%4%（注意这个数字啊喂）概率出血药，难道真的不是每个房间必出且仅出一个吗！？因为之前手机上都在玩soul knight，说实话那个掉血包的概率个人还是感觉不错的，当然电脑上的话难度要提高掉率自然应该低一些，那不妨设个7/8%的概率掉，有的屋子掉得多，有的反而可能不掉，这样更能增加玩家打罐子时候的那种期待感，如果玩家有那种没事下个房间还有一瓶药可以吃的感觉，那就少了一种乐趣。。。再不然你就直接把装备介绍改成每个房间必定掉落血药。\\n这也是第一次给一款游戏写评测，真心希望这个游戏能越做越好，有越来越多的人进来玩，加油加油！！！',\n",

       "    'review': \"One of the best, if not the best, Roguelike game, and it's just early access.\\n\\nI'd say that even Dead Cells doesn't have as satisfying combat as Hades. The characters in Hades also make the world and your journey way more dynamic and interesting. The amount of voice lines the different gods (or other npcs) have is actually astounding, even after 20 hours i feel like I've not heard anything twice.\\n\\nThe progression is also extremely satisfying with passive bonuses that you upgrade. And those passive bonuses don't really make you that much op, which is very nice. In this game, you feel the progress quite a lot, even if you die, you feel like you progressed, which is something a lot of games don't achieve. \\n\\nBosses are quite well done as well. They also have great lines and you even have few variations of one boss, which makes the journey not as repetitive and keeps things fresh. I didn't feel like there were any bad designs or anything of that kind, so i'd say well done here.\\n\\nOverall, This game, even in early access, is almost as good as Dead Cells. I don't think it has the more long term progression Dead Cells has, but it's just early access so it makes sense. It also has the story, characters, that make the world feel more alive and dynamic, which is something Dead Cells doesn't really have, so in that regard it actually triumphs over it. \\n\\nIf you like Roguelike games, this is a must buy. You will get tons of hours of great content with great characters and progression that keeps you playing for a while.\",\n",

The game is easily enough of a challenge with or without god mode. \\n\\nThere are plenty is unique powers, weapons and trinkets what help you develop different tactics for the boss fights, without making game play too easy. The sound has been done extremely well, the music in the boss fights gets the blood pumping and each time you die, you're motivated to make it further than last time.\\n\\nThe voice acting is an actual joy and each character is very well distinguished as well as being fun to converse with. Overall i think it's a fantastic game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to test their skills in a dungeon style game! I will give this game a 9/10! \\n\\nI hope this review helps other gamers who have taken an interest in this game but are yet to make up their minds.\",\n",

The gameplay always has me going back, with the desire to go further than I did before, or with some new weapon that I didn't complete that area with. It's quick, precise combat makes battling the hordes of the underworld just some great fun. Another thing I can respect is this game's active developers, continuing to add things to the game and just keep it an all around fun experience. If any game is worth the original price, this is it.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"This is a really great game, the weapons have all their unique perks. When I thought I wouldn't use a certain weapon I found ways that had great perks compared to to the others. Each weapon works better with certain boons compared to others and gives a whole new different play style. \\n\\nThe flow of combat is really awesome, with the wall bashing, pushing enemies into traps, deflecting their attacks, or even making debris fall on them. I loved dashing around with the  shield and ramming enemies into walls and lava. It was so satisfying just pushing them around into explosions or lava.\\n\\nThe story progression is really good as well, almost all the characters really feel for you and wanna help you which kind of in turn adds sympathy toward Zagreus, personally. The backstory is really intriguing the more it's uncovered. The more you die the more dialogue you uncover which is a nice touch.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that with the Titan Blood, being the hardest to get, I was really hoping for better upgrades. Especially the ones that cost two Titan Blood. There are maybe one or two upgrades that I actually liked. That is just my opinion and others may think otherwise.\\n\\nOverall I love this game a lot and would highly recommend it. I can't wait what they do next as they further update the game. I wish I could add more to this review because there is just so much that is great about it but I am really not good at reviews yet (this is actually my first one I believe). Sorry if this review was a bit shit :P\",\n",

       "    'review': \"The most polished early access game I've ever played. \\n\\nIf you're a fan of rogue-likes and action RPGs you're in for a real treat. The artwork is stunning and it runs flawlessly. The voice acting and adaptations of Greek mythological characters are really well done (seriously, there are endless snippets of well written dialogue) which leads to a surprising amount of character development (flavour). My favourite is Poseidon, what a bro. \\nThe gameplay is fantastic and incredibly satisfying. There's plenty in the way of weapon (ranged and melee) and build variety so each run is interesting, and the various permanent upgrades keep you motivated to get out and find more resources to trade. \\n\\nThe development team have a clear road map, make frequent large updates and have plenty more they want to add before the full release. I'd say it's more than worth your money now though, I can't believe this wasn't on my radar sooner!\",\n",

       "    'review': 'I highly recommend giving this masterpiece of a game a try. The visuals and art style are amazing, the writing is clever, funny and is really believable, and the music is just beautiful (exceptionally so for the songs sung by Orpheus and Eurydice). In addition to good looks and sounds, the gameplay is absolutely addicting and really hits that point of pure satisfaction that comes with rouge-likes. The best gameplay aspect though, has to be the way the weapons feel to use and how unique the whole experience feels, I\\'ve not once felt that I was simply \"going through the motions\" with combat or progression through levels and I\\'ve always felt challenged regardless of how well the run was going. TLDR: absolutely legendary PLAY IT NOW!',\n",

       "    'review': '作为一款还在EA的游戏，完成度已经非常高了，目前地图只有四章，但是足够玩很久了。\\n\\n优点：\\n1.爽！有手柄的游戏体验是远远高于键鼠的，动作流畅，非常爽快，尤其每次玩到后期各种恩赐加持的时候更爽。游戏虽然走的也是受苦路线，但是绝非黑魂一类的慢节奏，更像是鬼泣一类的爽快。\\n2.各种build随心组合，每次都有新花样。从目前的体验来看，每个神的恩赐都有侧重点且各不相同，每次重新开局因为恩赐的随机性都会玩出不同的花样，增加可玩性。\\n3.剧情有意思，对话不重样。故事主要讲的就是哈迪斯的儿子要离家出走，除了爹，所有亲戚都来帮他的故事……而且每次重新开局与所有人物的对话都不重样，让我深感制作组的用心，非常棒。\\n4.硬核但是不恶意，难度不小，但是完全没有恶意内容，你死了只因为你菜，而且死后用一种诙谐的手法让你从头再来，大大降低了类似同类游戏死亡的懊恼感。\\n\\n缺点：\\n1.因为关卡暂时不多，所以boss数量也偏少，虽然可以花式虐他们，但被他们虐的方式很单一，而且除了第三关boss和哈迪斯，前面两关的boss难度真心不够高。如果后面几关也类似第一关一样boss会随机切换就好了。\\n2.为啥没上成就系统？\\n3.不知道为什么最近玩了至少十几轮了，都没遇到大更新的冬季女神（之前有遇到），偃月刀也没了，更新内容只剩下钓鱼了，是bug吗？',\n",

       "    'review': \"[strike]It's okay I guess.[/strike]\\n\\nYou would not know this game was in early access if the devs didn't mark it as such. I know they've been working on it for a long time, but everything about this game is perfect. \\n\\nDisclaimer: I have never played a roguelike game before this one, and it sets the bar pretty high. It's only taken me so long to write a review because I was a little busy...\\n\\nThe artwork in this game is stunning. The colors, the environments, all of it is gorgeous. Darren Korb knocks it out of the park with the soundtrack once again. As he does with the voice acting, too! Each character has a fantastic actor behind them giving a stellar performance, and bro-Dionysus is one of my favorite gods. There's such life to each character, and the story wouldn't be the same without them. \\n\\nThe gameplay is so much fun. The variety of weapons and abilities creates limitless fighting styles and it is so exciting to play with different combos. Enemies are randomized across chambers and regions, but there are certain enemies that only appear in those regions (i.e. one specific type of ghost in region one, a different variation of the ghost in region two, etc) and the final bosses of the region are the same each time, with the same attacks and actions. Some may find this off-putting, but I like being able to learn their moves and kill them quickly instead of having new attacks I have to learn each time. \\n\\nThe little details in this game are enchanting. Certain rewards, cosmetic changes, and other smaller things help give this game another level of atmosphere that I adore. I simply can't recommend this game enough. A+++++, I've bought it for all my friends who put it on their wishlist because I want them to be able to experience it ASAP\",\n",

       "    'review': \"I've purchased this game almost randomly during the sale. It looked nice, had a roguelite tag, it's store page was filled with positive reviews - why not? I have never played a Supergiant game before. Now I will! \\n\\nHades is a roguelite with an excellent audio/visual presentation, memorable characters and smooth gameplay. It's variety is not as huge as some other games in the genre (like Binding of Isaac), but it makes it up in gameplay department. I've enjoyed it way more than similar games. Something here just makes combat feel way more... meaty? Also, unlike many bullet hell-ish games, the combat is a mix between melee and ranged. There are purely ranged and purely melee weapons, but on most runs you'll use both. \\n\\nThe story in this game is a little bit overrated, as at it's core it is quite simple. Still, characters are great and there are tons of dialogue lines, for a roguelite game at least. You can develop your relationships with characters you like, although many of those relationships are still WIP. And there are some clever jokes and references, but not to the point it becomes a parody.\\n\\nAnother thing different to many other roguelites would be amount of randomness you can control. You get to choose which weapon you want to start with, and also can influence the upgrades you'll get during the run. \\n\\nOne of the weaker points of the game might be it's replayability. It has decent amount of upgrades, currently 5 (soon 6) weapons, each of which can be modified in 1 of the 3 ways. There are plenty of crazy builds you can attempt to make. But boss, zone and enemy variety is a bit lacking. But hey, look at my playtime! All these hours I've had tons of fun.\",\n",

       "    'review': '优点：\\n·画面风格独特的rougelike，细腻，地图上的小细节也很丰富\\n·因为闪避可以打断动作，配合天赋甚至能增加闪避次数，所以游戏整体流畅度很高。用矛投掷天赋甚至能玩出复仇之矛的感觉！\\n·天赋的套路搭配很多，可肝的东西也比较有吸引力，所以重复游玩的乐趣不会下降的太快\\n·打击感音效配合手柄震动感觉很不错。手柄还会根据武器不同招式不同有相应的震动模式\\n·boss难度还行，对手残党还算友好，初见不熟悉技能会很懵圈，熟悉技能套路之后就相对简单。第二关boss九头蛇更新也降低了繁琐程度舒服很多。\\n·武器有不同形态\\n·地图上的机关很丰富\\n·伤害加成类型很多，比如陷阱，撞墙，死角。\\n\\n缺点：\\n·还有些对话没有汉化，虽然游戏还在测试阶段\\n·怪物种类还是略少，虽然游戏还在开发阶段\\n·流程比较短，但游戏更新速度还挺快，下次更新时间会早早告知，啊，这是优点了\\n·天赋比较看脸，要是恩赐刷的乱甚至不刷了，伤害会很低打起来会很难受，说的就是你一星卡戎弓！\\n·第一个刷的恩赐是随机固定的，不能通过进图放弃刷新，要么自裁，要么带回去戴定向配饰。\\n·自爆卡车在某些无击退效果的时候很不友好\\n·一旦玩熟了重复游玩性我觉得不是很高，一方面热度上的条款只是单单增加难度，对没有挑战欲的玩家来说可能会没啥意思，因为高难度所换来的奖励无非就是强化了一点武器形态，性价比太低。另一方面恩赐的种类还是有点少，每个种类的恩赐无非对应了几个按键加一些buff,debuff,恩赐之间的连携效果也没有很明显,食之无味弃之可惜。\\n\\n相比死亡细胞，故事性和流畅打击会更舒服，总的来说是个相当不错的rougelike游戏。\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'review': \"Se non avete voglia di leggere (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYat_479dA)\\n\\n\\nThe Binding of Isaac, Enter the gungeon, Dead Cells sono alcuni tra i migliori esempi del genere, ma dallo scorso dicembre possiamo aggiungere Hades all'albo d'oro dei Roguelike.\\n\\nSviluppato e pubblicato da quei ragazzacci della Supergiant Games, team californiano con alle spalle pietre miliari del carico di Transistor, Pyre e Bastion, questo Hades ci catapulta nella mitologia greca mettendoci nei panni di zagreus, principe degli inferi.\\n\\nAnnoiato dalla vita monotona e recluso nel Tartaro del padre Ade, Zagreus cerca costantemente di abbandonare la dimora di famiglia e ascendere al mondo dei vivi.\\n\\nContrariamente a quanto succede nella gran parte dei roguelike, Hades ci circonda con un mondo vivo e in continua evoluzione. \\nLa dimora di Ade è infatti invasa da entità mitiche con le quali possiamo interagire. \\n\\nStringere rapporti con loro è più importante di quanto possa sembrare dopo le prime run, infatti, insistendo, sbloccheremo non solo nuove scelte di dialogo che andranno ad approfondire la lore del titolo, ma riceveremo anche dei doni che andranno a potenziarci durante i nostri tentativi di fuga.\\n\\nMalgrado l'ambientazione, gli sviluppatori hanno deciso di raccontarci un Aldilà molto POP. Ogni volta che verremo sconfitti, rinasceremo al cospetto di nostro padre e verremo puntualmente sbeffeggiati dagli npc sopracitati, evidenziando non solo l'impossibilità dell'impresa, ma anche trattandoci da adolescenti cocciuti che prima poi cominceranno a fare gli uomini.\\n\\nPrima di cominciare ogni tentativo di fuga faremo puntualmente tappa nella nostra stanza e nell'armeria.\\n\\nLa camera, elegante e ricca di dettagli, nasconde lo specchio della notte, regalatoci dalla nostra matrigna Nyx, esso ci permette di attivare alcuni bonus mediante l'utilizzo delle chiavi che troveremo sparse per gli inferi.\\n\\nL'armeria, immediatamente adiacente alla Camera, ci da la possibilità di provare tutte le armi che abbiamo al momento,  visualizzando i danni che rechiamo e provare eventuali combo. Oltre alle armi è presente anche un armadietto con tutti i regali che gli npc ci hanno fatto, possiamo equipaggiarli e nel menù possiamo vederne le caratteristiche e le condizioni per poterli migliorare.\\n\\nScelto il nostro setup possiamo lanciarci nella mischia. Il gameplay è rapido e immediato, abbiamo a disposizione due attacchi differenti per ogni arma, rispettivamente sul click sinistro e sul tasto Q, mentre con il tasto destro lanciamo uno shard su un nemico abbassando le sue difese. \\n\\nI nemici saranno tanti, attaccheranno in massa e modi diversi, e tra un colpo e una schivata dovremmo anche stare attenti alle trappole presenti nelle stanze, e, come ogni Roguelike che si rispetti, più andremo avanti peggio sarà, i nemici si faranno sempre più numerosi e ogni piano presenterà lo stesso bastardissimo boss finale.\\n\\nDetta cosi l'impresa risulta davvero impossibile ma fino ad ora non abbiamo ancora parlato dei classici powerup presenti in ogni Roguelike che si rispetti.\\n\\nLa nostra spedizione infatti sarà supportata da tutti gli altri dei dell'olimpo che ci lasceranno, sparsi nella mappa, alcune benedizioni.\\n\\nQueste funzionano in maniera piuttosto diversa da come siamo abituati, una volta raccolte, dopo un breve dialogo che andrà ad approfondire l'affinità verso quella divinità, potremmo scegliere cosa il potenziamento andrà a migliorare e a seconda della qualità e del tipo di bonus potremmo assegnare degli effetti extra alle nostre abilità.\\n\\nOgni divinità avrà una sorta di scala evolutiva tutta sua, Zeus, ad esempio, ci permetterà di sparare saette con i nostri attacchi ed ogni qualvolta avremo accesso ad una sua benedizione, esso punterà ad aumentarne l'efficacia o magari ci permetterà di farceli generare da altre fonti, come la schivata o il lancio sul tasto destro. \\nPer questo motivo,  in vista di una creazione di una qualsivoglia build, vi consigliamo di concentrarvi sulla stessa divinità, a meno che non siete alla ricerca di uno specifico potenziamento, ma attenzione, non sono sempre uguali e soprattutto hanno una rarità.\\n\\n\\nIl mondo di gioco è incredibile. Il tartaro viene raffigurato come un immenso labirinto, la struttura delle stanze è spesso diversa e tra trappole ed eventi casuali la nostra esplorazione risulterà ogni volta una nuova sfida, è che sfida!\\n\\nPer quanto il genere risulti ormai ampiamente esplorato, questo Hades sarà capace senza dubbio di stupirvi. Le possibilità di crescita sono infinite e per quanto riuscirete a sentirvi forti e preparati il livello di sfida si impennerà sempre, sono un amante dei Roguelike lo sapete e se adesso ho voglia di spararmi un run in qualcosa, state certi che la mia scelta ricadrà su Hades.\",\n",

Music and art are fantastic and good at drawing you in.\\n\\nMy only feedback to the devs is with the companions mechanic. By the time I unlocked one I'd already established a style of play and I am constantly forgetting to use them. I suspect allowing one at least to be available earlier would have better fit it into my play cycles and taught me to use them better... but that's a minor complaint.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'This might be early access but it definitely doesn\\'t feel like it, I have yet to encounter a bug and no part of the game progress feels unfinished, it seems like the devs have taken the good approach of completely finishing a feature before releasing it which is a really nice refresher given the usual nature of early access games.\\n\\nNow when it comes to the game itself I am pretty amazed. I do enjoy roguelites but typically I get bored of them relatively quickly because there isn\\'t much to push for except \"I hope I make it past X amount of levels this time\". This original approach of incorporating an actual narrative in a way that makes sense with the core roguelite concept (which is really just to try the same randomised dungeon over and over again) really gives this little extra incentive to keep playing since you don\\'t just grind for levels and gear but also for the story. Hence, I have never felt a stronger feeling of \"just one more run\" in any roguelite I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nGraphically the screenshots speak for themselves. The voice acting is on point, giving each character a clear personality. The music is intense and makes fights that much enjoyable, not that it really needed it because the gameplay is really solid.\\n\\nThe fights are fast paced and the various boons/upgrades you can collect (and combine) from the different gods do make you play the game in slightly different ways every run and the different weapons each require a completely different approach to your fighting style. Worth mentioning also that every weapon eventually can be transformed into variations of itself; although those variations are pretty much another layer god boons.\\n\\nThe only little thing I regret so far is that the character upgrade system feels a bit...bland? you don\\'t really unlock new abilities and most of the upgrades are passive bonuses such as +5HP, +10gold, +1% of having X happen which feels a tad boring although the devs did mention working on some changes so we\\'ll see.\\n\\nBut overall this is a solid game even in its early access state that I can only recommend.\\n',\n",

The linear story progresses as you complete more runs and keep talking to NPCs, who have dialog to react to things that happen on the runs including when you beat the crap out of them during said runs. Honestly, I can\\'t even imagine the sheer amount of voice acting that went into this game...give me like 50 more hours of gameplay to estimate.\\n\\nCombat is excellent too, and you\\'re forced to adapt your strategy and style based on the buffs and mods you get during runs.\\n\\n10/10 Goodboy Pets, Who\\'s a goodboy??',\n",

       "    'review': \"Fast paced, Action Rogue-lite. There are not many games that capture this high speed action with random boons or perks that can vastly change each run. Death is a chance to grow stronger and go further. The weapon's are all unique and change up the gameplay in their own right. There is another weapon yet to come I'm looking forward to seeing! There is an element of RNG in perk selections, but skill can not be understated.  The lategame is setup brilliantly for an increasing challenge. This game does a great job of making you feel incredibly powerful, dare I say, godlike. And still find yourself crawling out of the Pool of Styx. Definitely a game you should try. I hope to see them put in more Gods and boons. The Long Winter was a great addition and makes me want more!\",\n",

       "    'review': \"I won't stop recommending this game to my friends until they play it. If anyone on my friends list sees this review - play this game. It's in early access but the amount of content already there is incredible.\\n\\nI played around 50 runs in about a week and I'm not stopping there. The recency bias has long disappeared and I still love this game. Within the first 10 hours I added it to my favorites category and it will always have a place in my heart as one of my favorite games. \\n\\nThe lore is amazing, it gives a great twist on Greek Mythology while still being informative and entertaining. I got really invested into the characters and became interested in raising my affection with them after a while. They were exciting to talk to and I was willing to put a pause on my game play to listen to their amazing voice lines. \\n\\nThe combat is amazingly snappy and satisfying, packing punch behind every hit with almost every weapon. The bow I believe could use some work as it feels clunky, slow and the aspects are lackluster compared to other weapons aspects. I love how many options there are for damaging enemies: attacks, dashes, dash-attacks, charge-attacks, special-attacks, casts and calls are all divine to use. The synergies for all of these are functional and what you would expect, rarely breaking. Knock-back, chain-lightning, hangover, doom and deflection synergies are thrilling and dynamic in their game design while the stat-effect synergy weakness is less appealing. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is detailed and while sometimes overwhelming, eventually becomes more easily parsed, allowing for better play and less moments of confusion over taking damage. A nice touch that would help atmosphere wise would be to see the green aesthetic shades appear in a room after clearing the hostile shades in Tartarus. For Asphodel, my casts sometimes get lost in the bending and shadowed walls beyond the lava shores, making it annoying to interrupt the game play loop to increase overall damage output. In Elysium, the wall spear traps have divots that cause the player to get stuck between them, taking continual damage. This has happened less as I learned to stay away from the walls in Elysium, however, it interrupted the game play loop many times and was an overall frustrating addition.\\n\\nI can visualize this game becoming a sensation and defining title among the rogue-like genre; If Hades continues adding new content and possibly more replay-ability in alternate path(s), compelling endings and delicious synergies, it will definitely become a classic I will return to for years and years.\\n\\n[table]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th][b]Category[/b][/th]\\n        [th][b]Rating[/b][/th]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Combat[/td]\\n        [td]9/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Lore[/td]\\n        [td]8/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Atmosphere[/td]\\n        [td]7/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Performance[/td]\\n        [td]10/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table]\",\n",

It took me a long time to get to the end and even after I have enjoyed every run to further make myself stronger for future content. I am STILL working to get everything maxed. \\n\\nI also want to give a special shout out to Darren Korb. He\\'s the guy who made the majority of the music. I very much appreciate the entire sound track. I find myself to regularly having the song \"Good Riddance\" in my head and appreciate the emotion behind the \"Lament of Orpheus\". All of the other songs...I wish I had more bass in my head phones to really rock out to it.',\n",

The characters you meet are plenty and unique, the story, albeit unfinished is engaging and the combat is a goddamn pleasure.\\n\\nWhat I particularly enjoy is the very meaningful character progression. You can improve yourself between each game, you can also customize your weapons and eventually add conditions to make the game more challenging and earn better rewards. I also like the way you gather godly boons during a game which can lead to amazing combos and completely change the way you play between two games. It makes each game feel fresh and unique.\\n\\nIt's in early access, regularly updated and already extremely solid. I wholeheartedly recommand it.\",\n",

Not to mention despite the difficulty my continuous play of it made it easy for me to memorize and get around enemies and bosses with the right gear.\\n\\nHaving said that, I love this game. Rogue likes in general are my favorite genre besides RPG's, I only sank 14.4 hours into this game but I did not leave because I was tired. This game is one I want to see succeed because it is genuinely an amazing game and so much fun to play, I did not want to review it when I came in. \\n\\nInstead I'd rather wait till now when a major update came out not too long ago that added bunches of more hours and more ways to play the game. If you want something to sink some time into that's fun and not multiplayer this is your game, and I highly recommend you check this out.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Gets boring pretty fast. I haven\\'t played many roguelikes, but I expected a bit more variety in enemies, rooms and \"viable\" power ups. Yes, there\\'s almost infinite possibilities for combining boons from different gods, but a lot of those combos aren\\'t really good, so you\\'re always hoping for a few boons and upgrades to show up every run.\\n\\nThe game is also kind of easy and although you can increase the difficulty via a few mechanics, it\\'s still very boring to keep repeating the same thing with tiny differences each time. I think it\\'s a good game if you enjoy grinding endlessly and aren\\'t really bothered by SLOWLY getting stronger while fighting the same enemies every 10 to 30 minutes. The story is cool, but also irrelevant (you can probably skip every dialogue and still understand the game just fine).\\n\\nAll in all, I find it hard to justify going back to the game at this point and even \"major\" updates haven\\'t improved that feeling by more than a couple runs for me. Maybe I\\'m just not the target audience for roguelike games, so if you really enjoy those and have dozens (maybe hundreds) of hours to spare, I imagine this would be a pretty good game for you.',\n",

       "    'review': \"Fantastic game, tons of replayability, 130+ hours in, and still not tired of the game. Each run can be wildly different based on your luck, and the game is in a pretty good state despite the early access tag. Game play is highly polished, and could easily pass as a fully developed game. Hell, even better than some fully developed games. The game don't feel overly hard, and feels like its in a good state of balance right now. As you play you'll get better at the game and a basic run is simply a breeze after awhile, between the upgrades and the player getting better. But that doesn't make the game boring as you can scale up the difficulty, which makes the game even more satisfying when you clear a high difficulty run, after dozens of attempts.\\n\\nThe dialogs in the game is deep and characters have great developments. At the end of each run, heading back to the house is a treat of itself. Despite spending so much time on the game, there's still some dialogs with the NPCs that surprised me, speaks volume of how much effort was put into the game. With each major update, not only are there some game play changes, there's even updates to the NPCs interaction that just absolutely delightful.\\n\\nThe developers is always listening to the community feedback, and is constantly improving the game. Can't wait for the next major update that's gonna add a lot more contents.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"This game is insane!! It's in early access, but it's more finished and polished than a lot of other games coming out with their full (or fully broken) release.\\n\\nI have longed for a hack&slash with a combat system like this. Although Hades isn't a traditional hack&slash, I don't know why it cannot fall into that category, at least in a broader sense: you crawl through a dungeon and kill monsters over and over. Except with a different concept, you don't find items but buffs instead. And instead of creating a new character to experience a new fighting style, in Hades you simply start a new run and everything is different and you adapt on the way. The focus is also on your fighting, not gear or skilltree.\\n\\nThe story isn't forced on you or given to you on a silver platter. You can engage in it by talking with NPCs and you get their perspective on things (everytime you die and take a break from fighting). Which makes it highly believable and intriguing.\\n\\nI had a ton of fun. Money well spent. Refund your WC3 Reforged and get this instead, you'll end up being happier.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Hades is easily one of the most fun games I\\'ve played in the last few years, and it\\'s not even done yet! The chamber-to-chamber movement, with a reward after each encounter, keeps the gameplay loop fresh and exciting even after you\\'ve been playing for hours. Combat leans toward fast-paced, dodge-intensive fights, but you can also get options to play safer and whittle down enemies if that\\'s how you prefer to play. In fact, I think what I love so much about Hades is that there doesn\\'t seem to be a lot of \"bad\" choices or builds; with practice and patience you can probably finish the game with just about any combination of weapon, boons, and trinket. The boons(upgrades that are lost if you die) all have a place and a situation where you\\'ll say \"Yeah, I can use that,\" and as you gain permanent upgrades that increase your boons\\' rarity(which affects the boon\\'s base power and allows access to more effects) and items that let you manipulate which god will give you their boon first, you can create more consistent runs with a more specific set of boons, or you can keep leaving everything to chance to keep to the roguelike spirit of the game. You will get destroyed on your first few runs, but once you get the hang of it, earn some upgrades, and make some offerings to your favorite characters, you\\'ll be hooked. \\n\\nWith a Supergiant game, it\\'s maybe unnecessary to point out the game delivers just as much on aesthetics as on gameplay. The Underworld is colorful and beautiful without compromising on being literal hell, the character designs are excellent, and the soundtrack by Darren Korb is fire. Even if you don\\'t end up playing Hades, the soundtrack is on Spotify and Youtube and is well worth a listen. \\n\\nFinally, the writing of the game is really good. You play as Zagreus, the son of Hades, the god of the Greek afterlife, and between dying painfully to traps and monsters scattered throughout the underworld, you have chances to talk to figures from Greek mythology like Achilles, Orpheus, and Cerberus(yes, you *can* pet the dog). You\\'ll learn more about each character over time, as well as uncover more about why exactly Zagreus is willing to risk his life over and over to escape Hades, and what has the gods on Olympus so interested in helping him break out. The story is not finished at the time of writing this review; but I\\'m very interested in seeing what happens in future updates.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be hard-pressed to find another Early Access game that feels, looks, and sounds as good as Hades. Buy it. 10/10\\n',\n",

       "    'review': \"Encore un excellent jeu de la part de SuperGiant Games. Un rogue-like (ou rogue-lite ?) très plaisant à jouer et qui donne toujours envie de retenter une run, dans la lignée de The Binding of Isaac ou Enter The Gungeon. L'univers et les personnages sont bien développés et très intéressants à découvrir, la BO colle parfaitement à l'ambiance du titre et le contenu est déjà assez conséquent, surtout que le jeu est encore en Early Access. Malgré quelques petits soucis par ci par là (certaines répliques qui passent soudainement en anglais et une ou deux baisses de framerate), le jeu reste extrêmement agréable à jouer, et on a vraiment un sentiment de progression, renforcé par le fait que l'histoire s'étoffe au fur et à mesure que l'on parvient à aller de plus en plus loin dans le royaume des morts. Le seul défaut assez conséquent serait le grind, qui peut paraître parfois assez fastidieux, mais rien qui ne nuise réellement à l'expérience de jeu selon moi.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"Hades is the next masterpiece crafted by SuperGiant Games.\\n\\nAgain, they deliver through action, visuals, storytelling and music. All of it is great. The mechanics are interesting and offer what is for me an addictive rogue-like type gameplay. Usually I am not that much of a fan of rogue-likes and I tend to lose interest because it doesn't feel like there is real progression. But with Hades... You really get this feeling of: *just one more try*. Or you wanna try something new or different on your next run. There is many ways to play this game and approach your playstyle. Plus, the game offers more than just repetitive runs. There are other characters that are interesting to get to know, and each have something to offer.\\n\\nSome might say that the story is not as strong as their other games', as it is not completely original like before but based on greek mythology. Sure, but I feel like this lets them focus more of the game itself; and the game IS a whole lot fun. Besides, the story is still fun and interesting enough to keep your interests peaked.\\n\\nIn short: if you like SuperGiant's previous games, than this is your next buy. Into rogue-likes or (isometric) action games? Definitely worth a buy.\",\n",

Artwork, sound effects, responsive gameplay, characters, voice acting, oh my god the soundtracks all on point. Darren Korb is a magician. It would say Hades gone far and beyond even though the previous titles were already set a very high bar. It has insane replayability and even when you keep resetting you feel like you are progressing at just the right amount. \\n\\nHades feels incredibly responsive. Soundtracks are amazing as usual. As of Feb 2020 in the state of early access game has more content than most of the games released and had a couple of DLCs over the years. In the gloom days of gaming clouded by Bethesda, EA, etc, Supergiant is a gem. Enjoy what they have to offer to the fullest.\",\n",

What\\'s interesting is that the narrative that has been woven into the core gameplay look is nice.  The characters understand that, \"Hey.  I know we keep doing this over an over, but I\\'m going to try to kill you again anyway.  Okay?  Great!\" Oh, and the voice acting really adds that special something.',\n",

Then again, this being from the same developers who made Transistor & Bastion, I shouldn't be that surprised.\\n\\nAs an action/rogue game, it has so much replay value and it's not even finished. Sure, there are some balancing issues with boons (buffs) right now, but I have faith that the developer will be working to make each one worthwhile in some build style. My only real complaint is that Athena's Divine Dash boon is almost mandatory to beat the existing game.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"What can I say about Hades? Pretty much the same thing I can say about all the other SuperGiant Games I've played. The controls are tighter than a formula one car, the visuals and art style are incredible as always, the characters are deep with superb voice acting and its the most fun action based rogue-like I've played. The only complaint I could make about this game is that there is A LOT of clicking and WASD manipulation, which for some of us older gamers with worn out joints means sometimes extended play sessions can cause some pain. But damn do I not even notice it most of the time, since I'm having so much fun. This is the most polished early access title I've played. Zero Crashes, I haven't found any bugs or encountered any errors. I cant wait to see what additional content lies ahead for Hades. ITS A HELL OF A GOOD TIME!\",\n",

The combat is meaty, with tight controls, the amount of permutations between weapons, boons, aspects, chaos etc is staggering. There\\'s a truly excellent feeling of progression, with very clever ways to make the game easier or harder incorporated beautifully into the overarching narrative and world feel.\\n\\nDespite this being \"early access\", it feels a lot more finished than many other games, there are very regular updates, the devs are quite open about what\\'s going on, what\\'s coming when etc etc.\\n\\nI\\'ve actually had the version on the other store where it was first released and played hundreds of hours, then bought it for Steam to support the Devs (and because of the other store\\'s clunkiness). The soundtrack, sound effects, lore, narrative, art, gameplay... I think it all comes together in an incredible game. I keep playing and playing, and somehow it feels fresh every day. This is an absolute work of art, it oozes style and you can practically feel the love that went into making it.\\n',\n",

       "    'review': \"First time playing a rogue-lite game. This is really addictive. For anyone wandering what rogue-lite means here, it's a game that doesn't have your usual campaign-win-campaign formula. Instead, you play using whatever skills and powers you have at the moment and get yourself as deep into the dungeon as you possibly can. Then you die. And dying is fun. Cause every time you resurrect, you gain the chance to get new powers and you can purchase new skills. And you start all over again - literally, all... over... again - level 1. Usually, starting from scratch every single time you die doesn't sound like much fun. But that's the beauty of rogue-lite games. The maps are dynamic, you never really get the same challenges again. It's always a little different, with new cut scenes and dialogue with the gods and such. In this game, you look FORWARD to dying. Some even die purposely... go figure. \\n\\nFor anyone wondering is it worth getting at early access? YES! It's 30 hours of fun, at the very least. And when you stop, you just can't stop thinking about maybe beating that bastard one more time...\",\n",

If you watch the trailer on the store page none of this should come as a surprise to you, but what did surprise me was the extreme replay value and longevity of the game. I simply can't stop playing it and the game isn't even finished! Many features that are hinted at in the dialogue are very exciting, and even after 80 hours I find myself discovering new strategies, interactions, and surprises. Without spoiling too much, the boss in the first world periodically changes. 80 hours in I fought a new and much more difficult form of the boss, and I was so excited and nervous during the introduction cutscene. An absolute gem of a game that was clearly made by a team with a sincere love of the rogue-lite genre and ancient Greek mythology, I would give it a 10/10 even in its unfinished state.\",\n",

Пройдя первый раз игру хочется пройти ее еще только по другому или взяв все плюшки за раз и т д. После прохождения Hades такого желания не возникает .Почему?Потому что скучно проходить 50-й раз эту уже комнату ,этих же монстров в ней,в такой же последовательности.Очень приедается.Пройдя последнего босса интерес резко падает и начинается его величество ГРИНД. Хочу сравнить hades с mmorpg,После того как прошел всю основную линию ты заходишь в игру на 2-3 часа чтоб выполнить ежедневные задания(ОДНИ И ТЕ ЖЕ),пройти данджи(одни и те же),и получить награды(как вы уже догадались одни и те же). Однако в мморпг ты можешь выбрать последовательность прохождения дейликов ,а тут нет. В мморпг есть другие игроки, а тут нет.\\nРекомендую игру на пару недель . Но цена у нее явно не на игрушку на несеколько приятных вечеров . Посему отрицательный отзыв',\n",

Zagreus, Sohn des Hades, versucht dunklen Familiengeheimnissen auf die Schliche zu kommen und aus dem Tartaros zu entkommen...dabei erbeutet er Kristalle und Edelsteine, mit denen er seine Fähigkeiten für zukünftige Runs verbessert, schaltet schicke Waffen frei und kann zusätzlich in jedem Run von den olympischen Göttern Gefallen in Form von Waffenfähigkeiten erwerben. Toll vertont, liebevoll in Szene gesetzt und absolut flüssig spielbar mit einem Controller. Empfehlung für jeden, der gerne mal einen geschmeidigen Dungeonrun zur Entspannung machen möchte.',\n",

       "    'review': \"If you looked at my review history, you could see that I have actually downvoted every single Supergiant Games game I've ever played. I've always been really unsatisfied with their generic plotlines and repetitive (near the endgame) level designs. I really have never been encouraged to play any of their games for very long. And none of their games felt very replayable to me. I've conceded that their voice acting, their ability to TELL stories, and their art is really high quality- but their story-oriented games were lacking in story, in my opinion.  Finally, I think they really hit the jackpot with this game. \\n\\nNot only is the gameplay engaging, but the story is honestly really unique and interesting. The gameplay is your stereotypical sort of roguelike dungeon crawler (think Enter the Gungeon), but the story really keeps me engaged. The characters are interesting and fleshed out, as well. So far, all the weapons seem balanced. I really have no complaints. I love the art, the voice acting, the plot, the characters, the gameplay- everything. \\n\\nIf you loved all their previous games, I don't know if you'd like this one because it's really very different. If you like roguelikes, I think this is really a top-tier competitor. And for the higher pricetag, I think this really holds a lot of potential for play if you like those sorts of games. I love it and I'm only a few hours in so far. I just felt the need to give a review because I really did not have huge expectations for this game. The only reason I bought it is because I really wanted a new rogelike and I figured it was pretty different than Supergiant's previous games. I think they really did a great job with this one.\",\n",

The combat is fast paced and fun, and the synergies of the boons you collect throughout your escape attempts are exciting and keep the game fresh. The use of classic mythology is awesome and engaging,  it's so cool to interact with each of the Gods of Olympus. Add in the hallmarks of a Supergiant game: fantastic voice acting, beautiful character design and great level design and you've got an easy 10/10 game.\",\n",
