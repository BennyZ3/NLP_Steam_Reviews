       "  'review': \"The developers described this an interview that they took great pains to avoid making another management sim. I have played it now twice for a combined total of 3 hours, in 2017 and now in 2020 after they've updated it. It was and is a very boring survivalist management simulator. There's no emotion, just your characters bumbling around the screen, there's no way to communicate with o NPCs, and after having played the game for two hour sI felt no better equipped to go scavenging or take care of my home than I did in the 10 minutes, so there was no sense of progress. It's very unclear the level of danger your characters are in until they are dead, so its hard to effectively manage the risks for them. I also felt that 3 characters in the house was either not enough or too many, either have so few characters the player is forced to make hard choices (2 or less), OR have 4 or more players so you can kick butt when you go scavenging. 3 players leads to the clear optimization of one person on guard duty, one person sleeping and one person scavenging. \\n\\n Only perk I would say is that it runs as a 64 bit executable on Intel Graphics on a Mac OS, which is a rare breed these days. As someone who games about 25 hours a year as a rare self-indulgence, its not worth it for me to use Boot Camp or buy a more substantial computer.\",\n",

It\\'s reminiscent of The Sims in that you have to take care of little people who walk around, get hungry, have health woes, and even emotional issues. \\n\\nAt night, the game is a little like Thief (in 2-D) -- you sneak out to various locations and try to get more stuff. One of the game\\'s big problems is that you are harshly punished if you don\\'t figure out the interface in time. You will spend literally hours trying to accumulate stuff and stay alive, but if you click the wrong button on accident you lose all your progress, and the game won\\'t let you rewind: If your character dies, that\\'s it, he/she is dead. There\\'s no save to go back to. \\n\\nYes, \"That\\'s the way things are in war\"  -- a combination of tedium and danger. Fine. But it stinks to play a game for 5 hours and then abruptly die because when you clicked \"Run to Exit,\" the game made you go to an exit on THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN that you didn\\'t know was there (and hadn\\'t unlocked yet). That doesn\\'t teach you about war -- that\\'s clunky programming. This kind of unforgiving game-play is dumb and extremely frustrating.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the shelter portion of the game, there are game interface flaws that degrade the experience. For example, you can build an item and you can also chop that same item up to get firewood (for when it is deathly cold in the winter). One such item is the indoor garden -- which requires loads of precious resources to create. \\n\\nWhen you\\'re using the garden, there is a single icon, but when it\\'s finished (when your character has planted carrots or something), the single icon moves over and there are two icons, side-by-side, with one being the icon to chop up the whole gardening station and use it for firewood. Simply because of a program interface flaw, you might accidentally destroy your garden without meaning to! And guess what? There is no stopgap such as \"Are you sure?\" This would have been entirely programmable, if the creators had the foresight to realize the flaw of their interface.\\n\\nThe game is intriguing nonetheless. There are occasionally moral decisions to make -- usually a question of whether to steal from others. If you do, then your characters become depressed. You can let them play guitar or smoke cigarettes to feel better. Needless to say this is all a little shallow for a game attempting to replicate the horrors of wartime.\\n\\nI played the whole thing through just to finally get to the end of the war. It is anti-climactic: the game abruptly ends and you see some scrolling images summarizing a few of the things that happened while you played. The real reward was having a good excuse to stop playing. I did find the experience different and involving for a while, though.',\n",

Is it the weapon? Is body armor taken into consideration when calculating hit chance? I don\\'t know, and I\\'m not going to look for it, since it is quite crucial for the survival of your characters, given that if they \"miss\", the person that you\\'re trying to shank will swiftly give your character a proper good smack and yeet a quarter of their health away, and the game should at least explain how hit chance is calculated. \\n\\nAnother issue is with the way guarding works. Or rather, how it doesn\\'t work. \\nWhat increases the chances of the person I left on guard duty not getting shanked? What decreases the chance of things being stolen? I dunno, and at this point I care very little to find out. This part of the game wouldn\\'t necessarily have to be explained, but some kind of text during the debrief of the previous night about an approximation of how many people broke in would be less frustrating. I\\'m always left wondering why all of my food got stolen, but the character I put on guard duty is fine, and the text said that \"We managed to scare them off\". That would imply that there were two bandits at most, and they managed to take off with all of my food, something that the person on guard duty should attempt to protect at all costs. If they would\\'ve gotten injured during that encounter, that would\\'ve been fine, but the way I imagine it going down is the thieves rummaging through the fridge while the guard is standing in the other room yelling at them. It makes sense for the thieves to steal valuables while the guard has just been injured and is trying to deal with their wounds. It also makes sense for the guard to be distracted by at least two thieves, while at least one other is yoinking what he can. But with zero information about how many people broke in, it just feels like the characters I\\'m putting on guard duty are afraid of doing their job and guarding their own possessions.',\n",

Nevertheless, being that aside, as a game in itself that I will rate for, I would not recommend.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Good story\\n- Unique\\n- Good character interactive game play\\n\\nCons:\\n- Tons of bugs/glitches/illogical that will make user repeat over and over again\\n\\nI cannot remember all the bug/glitches that I come across when I return to play this, but two things that I always encounter to stop playing are:\\n- Character being stuck/immobile\\n- NPC thinking they've seen my character(s) previously when they have not (area is considered 'one' entity, player character(s) considered 'one' entity) all NPC in an area will regard player characters as a whole recognized when their 'live' NPC have not seen my character(s), only visiting or been seen by DEAD NPC still counts as seen\\n\\nThis may be one simple thing that make players repeat the game all over again several times. So no matter how many times I return to play this game again after updates, I always seem to leave for the same reason.\",\n",

Don't get it if you are using a raspberry pi and a potato clock to run it, and save it for your 2080 so you can get that buttery smooth 300 fps to suck you into the mood of war-torn Totally Not Ukraine. If it were still being updated and the game was still being optimized to be able to run on my turd of a laptop at more than 5 fps, I could easily overlook the instability and glitches. As it stands, it's a great anti-war game that shows the true victims of combat, and a true experience if you want to feel terrible for all the villages you burnt down during the 60's.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'First thing:  I do recommend this game, with caveats.   But, given only a thumbs up or thumbs down review, I thought I should try to be objective.  I think you should know what you are getting into before purchasing this game - it could be thought of as \"The Sims - Misery DLC.\"\\n\\nThe graphics are beautiful in the representation of miserable surroundings.  The characters are given enough personality for you to feel for their situation.  The game mechanics flow well.\\n\\nCharacters have bios and specific things they like.   A character may be a cigarette smoker and if you find cigarettes this may provide them a small respite from despair.  But, not too much.\\n\\nYou start out with three players in your hideout.  You can give them commands, such as scavenging, building objects, eating, healing or sleeping.  The days go by fast, make sure to get enough sleep.  Your players will quickly be on the verge of collapse.\\n\\nWar is hell.   This is a simulation of their day to day fight to stay alive when staying alive is all that matters.  The game play is in two parts - day and night.  \\n\\nDuring the day you can build crude devices in your hideout to keep your players alive, such as a stove, heater, beds, weapons.  It looks like the standard building mechanics - you need enough of supply A to build part B to use in tool C.  If you don\\'t have water, combustibles, a stove and food, you can\\'t make soup.  A trader will usually come to the door and you can barter for things you need.  Be prepared to give away a lot to get very little in return.  I have not seen any leveling up, just a slow sad spiral into hunger, depression, exhaustion, sickness and injury until they are broken.  You can heal your players but it never lasts very long.  You never have enough supplies, your players will always be hungry, hurt, depressed and sick. \\n\\nAt night, one of your players can go to other sites on the map and scavenge for food and supplies to keep yourself alive.  You control the scavenger while the others remain behind at your hideout.  Scavenging is a bit of stealth and can be a moral dilemma.  Will you rob the old couple in their house, or leave them alone?  Will you ignore the old man\\'s pleas to leave his wife medicine, or steal it to heal your injured comrade?  Can you avoid the other occupants of other hideouts, or will you beat them to death and risk getting shot.  These decisions weigh on the conscience of the scavenger when s/he returns.   \\n\\nWhen you return from scavenging, you are updated on what happened while you were out scavenging.  It may be a calm night, or raiders may have come and stolen supplies and injured your players that stayed behind to stand guard.  Your players that remained behind may have abandoned your hideout and do not come back.  If one of your players was sick or injured, they might have died.  If a player was depressed, they may have committed suicide.\\n\\nI think the goal of the game is to survive until the armistice or ceasefire.  I haven\\'t made it that far yet.   Maybe you can reach a point where you have enough food, supplies and weapons that you can barricade yourself in and ride it out.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\nAt the end of the game, you are given a recap of every significant action taken in the game, such as players dying, robbing or killing others.  During one of my games, two players abandoned my hideout while the third died from his injuries.  On the final screen of the game, I found out that the two players that left the hideout were shot and died.  One was shot while trying to cross the border to get to his family, the other was shot when a trade deal went bad.\\n\\nThis is what you are getting into.  I would recommend this game to someone who understands what Cormac Mccarthy\\'s \"The Road\" is.  Think of a Solzhenitsyn video game.   I would not call it \"fun\" game play and you will not be laughing while you play it.  I do not think this would be a good party game.  It\\'s a misery simulator that can be addicting to play, just to see if can get them to survive another day, or figure out the game play to make the struggle easier.  The game itself masterpiece but I don\\'t know if I would want to play this over and over again just because it such a melancholy game and the struggle seems too real.\\n\\nSo recommend it, sure.  But this is not The Sims or a fantasy RPG where you keep getting more powerful and magical healers cast spells to heal their crew or an FPS that lets you upgrade weapons to keep destroying all the demons the game can throw at you.   There is no conjuring or superpowers.  This War of Mine is gritty, depressing and probably not for everyone.  \\n\\nMaybe everyone should play it.  The other side of this is that it all seems too real and this is not fantasy.  It has happened to humanity before, it is happening now and it will keep happening.  This is your chance to experience misery and hell on earth from the comfort of a computer game.',\n",

The random encounters are way too few, so you end up giving meds to the same children and helping the same dude protect his wife from rapists in every single playthrough. Some random generation would solve most of these problems, and make the game much more replayable.\\n\\nThe psychological elements need some polishing as well, as they can sometimes lead to absurd situations, like a surivor committing suicide out of guilt because he stole bandages to dress the wound of a dying child.\",\n",

This one profile limit that autosaves after everyday is unacceptable given the circumstances.

But now pathing for my characters and the NPCs has completely shit the bed. \\n\\nI just tried silently executing somone with a knife which is a 100% insta-kill no matter the circumstance and when I click on the NPC with the correct symbol hovering over their character my character will step out of the shadows, walk in a circle for no reason and get shot by the NPC they were supposed to quickly intakill before they are seen.\\n\\nAlso when an NPC is patrolling if I am hiding in the room, they wont see me but they will stand there for 4+ in-game hours as if they are waiting for me to hop out. They never heard me, saw me, or knew I was there because I hadn\\'t attacked anyone yet. I have also seen NPCs get stuck on a wall A WALL IN A 2D GAME, THEY WILL PIVOT BACK AND FORTH AS IF THE WALL IN THE BACKGROUND IS PREVENTING THEM. \\n\\nI cannot recommend this game which breaks my heart because they have donated money to charities with fractions of what they make from the game and its been so fun for years but until they fix problems that have only ever started recently after certain updates this isnt worth investing in if the AI is broken and unpredictable. \\n\\n(all of this happened in the classic mode, not in the stories where everything is pre-determined and scripted including your characters and when specific things happen)',\n",

       "  'review': \"I love this game.  It's one of my favorite games of all time.  Don't buy it.  The developers broke their own fu**ing game with this update.  When you get raided you use up all the ammo you have in your inventory, regardless of how many guards you have.  If not, you use up about 99%.  If you have mods activated you can't find any items in the new locations.  Yeah that's right, aside from NPCs, if you go to any scavenging pile you'll find nothing, except for one or two useless things.  Combat is even more broken and sh*ty than before.  Now enemies can survive shotgun blasts to the face at point blank and kill you with three shots, even if you're wearing armor and a helmet.  And most damning of all, custom characters do. Not. FUC*ING.  WORK!  If you create a custom character that's a female, there's about 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% chance you can select them.  Regardless of mods being on or not.  EVERY FUC*ING TIME I'VE TRIED TO USE CUSTOM FEMALE CHARACTERS THE GAME CRASHES EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST TIME I GOT INTO THE GAME AND FOUND OUT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER BUGS WITH THE GAME.  THIS IS STUPID.  THIS ONE FUC*ING BUG IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO PRACTICALLY BEG FOR A REFUND.  I'M SERIOUS.  FIX YOUR DAMN GAME DEVELOPERS.  Please.  I'm asking nicely.  Fix the bugs.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'So here is my little review.\\n\\nFirst of all let me say that this game is not worth purchasing for full price and it is most certainly not worth purchasing as solo base game without DLCs & season pass.\\n\\nBase game is extremely repetitive and very challenging AT START when you have no idea how all game mechanics work, such as resting, what to build ect. There is a bit of sneaking which is always Quite fun, otherwise the mine problem is \\n\\n1. There is very limited amount of locations you can go to (so you know exactly what to expect once uve been there)\\n2. Due to huge amount of materials in each location, you have to return there sometimes up to 5-6 times to get all you might need to further improve your base\\n\\nThis could be easily solved by either putting up more locations with less materials, or allowing you to return to a place in the same night more than once if you reach it within a time limit (sometimes you ltierally walk in, pick first pile you see and you can go back - certainly didnt take me whole night, did it?)\\n\\nAtmosphere is Quite nice as well as graphics, certainly shows that in war that there arent just soldiers and heroes, but many, many ordinary people - all generations, with all kinds of skills and stories.\\n\\nRegarding the season pass, stories -\\n\\nFirst story is completely crap. Now why is that? Because you are forced into a role of father saving his daughter, no choices to be made - you simply have to save your daughter, this is bad because it does not work with the game design, if I want to submerge myself into story I probably dont wanna spend whole day building a herbal garden or distilling alcohol while my poor kid is somewhere out there raped by bandits. Also there is some dirty homeless guy sayin he tells me where she is only if I bring him food. You know what any sane parent including me would do? Take that crowbar I had in hand and beat him until he tells me. First story - unplayable.\\n\\nSecond is interesting and gives you a lot of choices, I wont really spoil, but this time you wont be listening to radio. It is also nice addition that the guy has broken legs so you are very limited in what to do.\\n\\nThird was certainly my favorite and this is where the game shined for me, I work as an antique dealer so saving art really touched me. It was Quite challenging as you are playing in cold winter, you need constant lumber to keep the fire going - but its hard to come by, and even more - you can destroy the art to make wood, tough decision, be cold or save the art....\\nI of course refused to burn any art, later when I got to museum I saved all the stuff, milena was captured and released...soI wated for her to return. I was running low on food and everyone was sick, it kept getting worse, had to barter EVERYTHING to the last gear I had for medicine and vegetables....milena wasnt commin, no she wasnt. I tought I could escape along with art with the kids so I gave them the jewish items, but it seemed I still coudlnt escape. Siding with the guy who has a vault seemed like a poor decision - I wanna get the art out of the city, not keep it there, even tho somewhat safe.... So the colonel it was, sacrificed the most important piece to get us out. Fool me, milena returned, colonel killed her and stole all stuff...but alas, at least we saved lifes. Makes one wonder if legacy is indeed more important than life. Surely touched me.\\n\\nOverall: Worth at sale. Not worth the full price. Very repetitive, time consuming and stale. Preferably play it in the background.  Wish I could give neutral review.',\n",

I really had no idea what I was doing because the main menu offers no explanation of what to expect from the two game modes.\\n\\nI'm on my second night, thinking this game is pretty cool so far. I'm getting into it. Then I realized my IRL phone needed charging, so I plugged it into my PC. This game crashed. Huh. Weird. Must be some strange glitch. No matter, I just won't plug my phone in again while playing. Try to launch the game. Black screen. Click around aaand it crashed. Okaaay, maybe having my phone plugged in is the problem? Unplug and launch the game. Black screen and crash. Try again. Same result. Try reinstalling to no avail. Turn to Google. See lots of people between 2016-2018 having crashing issues. See some responses from devs telling people to try a bunch of different things to make the game work. \\n\\nWait. What? Your game (which is not in beta) is having this many issues and you're putting it on players to fix it so they can play? No. I'm done. Uninstalled. Goodbye. Bad review. Will not support devs who can't actually dev.\\n\\nThis is a shame, I really liked the half hour I got to play and was looking forward to more.\",\n",

This game runs awfully and the devs just don't seem interested in fixing glaring issues.\\n\\nFor example. Alt + Tab will make the game lock up and it's 50/50 if it recovers. Checking the Steam Discussions, it seems the devs know that the issue exists with the engine and that it can't be fixed. (Suck it up) \\n\\nLeaving an area after looting is also 50/50 if the game will crash. (Losing your progress as the save is based on the in-game day before)\\n\\nMod's raise this chance to around 20/80 if it will crash doing anything. Weird to see for a game that openly has workshop support.\\n\\nI'm not saying avoid. If you can live without Alt + Tab and any mods, then the game can be a real challenge. But you'll quickly realise there’s a lack of content.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I have almost 300 games in my steam library and all of them work without me having to go through SO MANY HOOPS to try to get a game to work! I followed every single thread I could find to fix the BLACK SCREEN ISSUE and none of them work for me. I am sure that the developer has plenty of \"Console Output logs\" to have figured out the issue. The developer has even claimed this issue has been fixed since new versions have came out, yet there are still some getting these errors. \\n\\nI am able to play games from windows 98 to the latest releases, what is so different about this game that requires the user/player to make so many changes on their end just to start the game? I know the game came out a few months before Windows 10 released, but that should have been one of the first things the developer addressed before moving on to DLCs so they could \"future proof\" the game for players that wanted/needed to upgrade (their OS). This also should have been addressed for future sales! \\n\\nI really looked forward to playing this game, but after spending so much time trying to \"FIX\" something that should have been \"PATCHED\" by the developer has left me frustrated and disappointed to where I would not want to play if i DID get it to work!\\nIf this was a new development for something that changed years after the game came out, I would be more understanding, but the \"BLACK SCREEN\" issue can be traced back to the year the game was released and BEFORE Windows 10! \\n\\nI really hope that the developer finally fixes this issue for good in such a way that the player can just play without having to change anything or follow a manual just to get it started. Maybe they can patch it so it will START in windows mode instead of having to change settings or download third party apps. Then maybe I will update my review after actually being able to play the game. Until then, I don\\'t believe the game should be actively sold to users if its broken and cant be played. Going through the REFUND process isn\\'t fun for either side!',\n",

After i updated the game, i played the brand new character and the new locations from the DLC and it worked in the first attempt. after i clear the game, i tried the second attempt which also include some new locations from the DLC. BUT IN THE SECOND ATTEMPT, I CAN\\'T SCAVENGE IN THE LOCATIONS FROM THE DLC. IT JUST SHOWS THE LOADING SCENE AND THEN FORCE CLOSE ITSELF. This update has clearly made me disappointed as i was recommend this game in my last review. but now, i don\\'t recommend this game to those who want to play this game. there are also some bugs that the devs are still hasn\\'t fix such as when you click during the loading scene, the game close itself and you have to start all over again during the day which is suck. please fix this. i really have high hopes with this game',\n",

Sickness and injury seemingly can only heal with a night spent sleeping, regardless of whether the person rests all day and does nothing.

       "  'review': \"This game is okay if you like this kind of thing, but it's not great.  It's got the side-on house view similar to Distrust (if that's the game where you're running a bunch of apartments) mixed with the frustrating managing of insufficient resources akin to XCOM.  It's very difficult to keep your characters alive when the game doesn't explain how to, and you don't know which things you need to build (or how to), or which scarce items you'll need to buy/find, until it's too late, and you can't even reload an earlier level.  Etc.  There's no explanations as to why the thing you bought that looked like food can't be eaten, or why the character can do one action but not another, etc.  You only find this stuff out by Googling and finding that many other people were just as confused as you were.  It really wouldn't kill game developers to include a manual of some sort.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Pretty engaging if you\\'re in the mood for an immersive feel, but there\\'s very little to do, and what there is you\\'ll do about ten thousand times because, once again, it\\'s a scavenging simulator with almost no inventory space. Everyone is sick or tired no matter how long you let them rest, and giving them medicine only give you maybe a day of good health AFTER they\\'ve continued to rest and heal for three days. It kind of makes the same mistake that so many other survival games do when they try to make it \"realistic\"; it\\'s made as though your characters are average joes, not supersoldiers. I\\'m all for that, but it\\'s frustrating to play characters that are apparently incapable of adjusting into a wartime mindset. \\nadd backpacks, or allow people to carry more than like, 20 pounds of stuff.............................\\nadd component medicines and foods that can be improved to better versions. And if you\\'re going to require 4-5 meals to get someone from starvation to satisfaction, maybe add more ways of generating food.\\nActually, all my negative feedback would be inconsequential if you added a simple calculus that reduces a character\\'s demands for food, sleep, etc. as you go.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This review leaves me with mixed feelings. I've played this game in the past and to be honest it was a lot better then, I really REALLY loved it and i tried to replay it now after a lot of Frostpunk, however..... the game now as it stands after the devs tweaked hidden game settings over and over again has just become an awful experience. Lets go over it\\n\\n1: Raids, these will happen on a near nightly basis even from the first day on the first campaign. You put 2 people on guard? Too bad you have no weapons so the raiders take all your food. GG restart. Same shit happens on day 2? GG restart again. \\nWhy does this piss me off? Because years ago raids weren't anywhere near as frequent, from the getgo raids exist PURELY to tax your bases resources and injure people. In a real world if you shot and killed people who attacked you in a warzone, youd loot their corpses for weapons, armor and ammo. In this game? All you do is lose resources to raids, this was fine until they tweaked the settings so that its basically a 50/50 chance of getting raided every night right from day 1 even outside of a crime wave\\n\\n2: Random map locations, you can get literally screwed over so hard by getting locations that you're forced to either steal from people and get massive mood penalties or super hard combat locations like construction site, hotel, etc right on day 1 as your only choices to work off of. Either you lose in the first week from depression or people are killed by the combat with no weapons. You can say to tiptoe or do cautious looting, except that this is PURELY rng dependant on what you start with, and you can frequently get so screwed at the start you have to just exit and restart the scenario for better locations. Thats a problem where im sitting\\n\\n3: Theft triggers. Even after all these years there are countless locations like the notorious Hotel that STILL proc negative theft penalties when your killing people that even ingame on that map is saying are lunatics (the mutilated bodies in hotel for instance that says theyre psychos), yet you loot the place after euthanizing their blight? Enjoy depression in your house, good times. That bug has been around since the very get go, still around.\\n\\n\\nLook, I can cheese a game, i can strategize like most of the best and find a way to make it work, but thats not what my review right now is about. Its about how the game is more painful to play then it used to be, it doesn't force hard decisions on you for the sake of morals now, but rather forces you to get screwed by overly tuned mechanics that tie you into the same cookie cutter play style EVERY map now\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll go against the grain here and won\\'t recommend this game. Reading other reviews, a lot of people liked this game because it is allegedly so gritty, realistic and unusual. But it just isn\\'t a good game, in my opinion. \\n\\n\\n[h1]First, the story.[/h1] \\n\\nThere isn\\'t one besides that you are stuck in a city ravaged by a civil war and it sucks. Instead, the game just constantly hammers its message home: war is bad and innocent people get hurt. Who knew? It\\'s not even subtle. In the hospital, you find a note that the pediatric wing was hit the hardest in a shelling and most kids died. In the supermarket, a soldier is sexually assaulting a woman and there\\'s nothing you can do about it. Kids are begging for meds for their mother. That kind of thing. And in case you somehow miss all that, there\\'re a few F... the war graffiti around. But luckily, the greatest problem your guys have is that they\\'re out of coffee or cigarettes.\\n\\n\\n[h1]But more importantly, the gameplay is not very good, either.[/h1] \\n\\nOver day you\\'re stuck in a house where you can do some crafting and your guys can eat and sleep. Occasionally, a trader or people looking for help come around. At night, one of you goes out scavenging. \\nThe days are absolutely tedious. Every day, you have to scan the radio, make firewood, cook food, make water, tell your guys to eat and sleep, and take care of your other crafting. It\\'s completely repetitive. And you have to do all that by point & click if you play with mouse and keyboard (don\\'t know how it works with controller). There isn\\'t even the option to speed time up, you have to wait until they veeerry slooowly finish what they are crafting before you can send them to the next task. \\nThe nights aren\\'t much better. Try to sneak through the different locations, grab all the stuff, go home when your backpack is full. In some locations, you can trade but you have to bring whatever you plan to trade and since neither \"prices\" are fixed nor the trader\\'s inventory, it\\'s almost impossible to predict what you\\'ll need.\\nCombat is basically spamming your mouse button and hope for the best.\\nThere\\'s no RPG element whatsoever, so you don\\'t get better at combat, sneaking or trading, you can\\'t even craft a bigger backpack - there\\'s no change, no progression, it all stays the same.\\n\\nAll in all, I was pretty disappointed. I like base-building games. I like strategy games. I like stealth games. In theory, this game is right up my alley. But the only strategy involved here is the sequence in which you build/upgrade additional crafting benches and finding enough supplies to do that takes several days of scavenging. There\\'s a couple of options to generate food but they are pretty useless and take a lot of supplies, a lot of time, or both. The stealth part isn\\'t that great, either. If anyone is moving close by, you wait until they went elsewhere or take a different route. Basically, everything in this game is tedious and takes too long and there\\'s absolutely nothing that makes up for it. \\n\\nSo, I recommend this game for people who like being bored and depressed. The rest should maybe give Sheltered or Mark of the Ninja (if you like stealth) a try instead.',\n",

However, the rate at which the members of your house get sick, starve, are exhausted, are wounded, etc, it's just a bit much. \\n\\nFor me, I would have like the game to play out just a little longer per session. Like let me live a week or 10 days in my first 1 or 2 trys, not 4 days. I also felt that my parties character development was lacking. There's text in the game about their lives, but I'd have rather experienced it. Like take that first week to have the party converse with each other and open up. Just a different way to present the same content. Also there were times where doing something had no consequences whereas other times it meant getting shot to death. Some sort of warning system, or morality meter showing you how bad the thing you're doing is, would have been helpful IMO.\\n\\nSo for me it would be a pass.

       "  'review': \"This game fails because it seems to miss the point of playing games. FUN. This game is so far from fun it is incredible that they call it a game. It is depressing, stressful, and the worst offender is how slow and boring it is. The basic gameplay loop is: Character whines at you about being hungry, the next night you go on a mission to find food, your guy gets hurt instead, the next day you have a guy whining at you about being hurt and another about being hungry, you go on another mission, they find litereally nothing, you go back the next day and everyone is whining at you. Seriously how is this worth my time? The one hour I played felt like 10 and I didn't enjoy any of it. It's really sad because the concept here is neat, just the execution is a complete disaster, can hardly imagine why it's so well-recieved, guess a lot of people like taking care of whining, sick children or something.\",\n",

But the actual gameplay leaves a lot to be desired for me. Firstly, while I get that it's about atmosphere and mood, the game is always depressing, at least as far as I have gotten in it. Also, it's completely frustrating in the fact that it's too hard, and the stakes are too high right from the beginning. The first time one of your scavengers gets into a sticky situation -- he/she's dead. I've read guides. I've started and restarted the game several times just to try and get a decent foundation, but this game is all about losing it seems. You either lose quickly, or you lose slowly. Too frustrating for me and not fun. A beautiful waste of time.\",\n",

Your characters will whine- Every. Damn. Day, to no end about literally everything! This game is worse than listening to whining kids in Fortnite, because the game IS all about managing how much they whine. I actually started killing my characters off intentionally because all they did was whine.  The entire game is about balancing their hunger, or getting injured by people raiding you at night and needing supplies to heal up. But you can't just go loot places, the game makes you pick which places you loot and if you decide to loot 'nice' people, then your character gets sad and  mopes around all day then will cry like a little bitch then vanish into the night. Sorry but if I ever had to group up with these people in the event of a real Apocalypse, I would be kicking them out day 1 for being QQ salty bitches.\",\n",

I've given it seven different attempts now and the furthest I made it was day 7.\\n\\nThis game, and They Are Billions are the bane of my game's list. There is practically no sense to them. They're both staggeringly difficult to me because both have practically non existant tutorials. And for some reason the fans who enjoy the challenge start to chew out the fans like myself who can't get through them. I'm sure the story, as poorly translated in English as it was as far as I got, is truly moving. But if I wanted a truly moving, and good game with a fantastic story I'd go play Valiant Hearts : The Great War, because it truly was a better game in every sense with a slightly similar premise. However this game has just a fantastically massive problem, it's added too much onto it's basic mechanics. This is a 2d Side scrolling strategy RPG. With little strategy, little role playing, and little much else. I simply do not care for it and find it to be too challenging for I'm sure all the wrong reasons. I don't recommend it for the simple fact it has practically no tutorial and unless you're the type of person who doesn't stray from a challenge and eagerly looks to go back to something multiple times from scratch, which I am not, more for you, this game is all yours.\",\n",

I don't want to emulate real life. I'm looking for challenges and entertainment. The game needs to give players the opportunity to control game time - speed up and slow down, depending on what you're doing. Allowing only one survivor to scavenge also slows the game down and that's not realistic. In 'real life' people would be more likely to go out in pairs to protect one another and to carry more stuff. I tried re-starting the game 5 times to acquire defensive weapons but it requires a level of meticulousness and detail that is not enjoyable.\\n\\nIt's worth $10 but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it unless the developers start listening to their player customers and build in more things top do and control over elapsed time.\",\n",

The game consists of two parts, your base during the day and scavenging during the night, if you have someone up for the task. There is very little to do at your base since resources are so scarce, you can maybe build one or two things before skipping to night.\\n\\nThe nights, thus far, are the only times you even have a chance for any action, but even then it is rare. Most of the time, due to inventory restrictions, you'll find yourself returning to the same empty spots to gather left over resources. <- In four hours this has been the majority of the game. I'm still on my first run through. There just isn't enough variation in this game to merit more time unfortunately. The doom and gloom atmosphere created by decent music and graphics has done more to push me away than draw me in.\\n\\nThe lack of options and variation for the sort of game this is really makes the title feel incomplete.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'How to describe this shitty game? Best i can say is that it feels like a mediocre free to play game. Don\\'t waste you time with this game, it really isn\\'t fun. Gameplay is divided up into daytime and nighttime. during the day you can run around your base, craft stuff, build, etc. but there isn\\'t much to build, it will take 20 seconds at most (after day one) to do what you want to do during daytime, and the is no option to speed up passage of time other than to instantly start night time. at night you can scavenge and this is where most of you time will go as you explore new areas. You have three guys, only one can scavenge, the other two can sleep or gaurd. If you don\\'t gaurd you will get supplies stolen every 3 nights on average and if you only send one to gaurd with no weapons he will get injured. If you don\\'t sleep for two days, they will get tired and eventually unable to do anything BUT sleep. You can\\'t send more than one guy to scavenge, the only important nightly activity as it is the only way to get more stuff. even the survivor that is specificlly good at scavenging can\\'t hold very many items, 15 maximum.\\n\\ncombat is dogshit, you will get killed instantly by enemies with guns if you don\\'t have one, and if you lose even one survivor you might as well just quit and start over. There is no save function, meaning you can\\'t save when you want. You save every morning automatically, thus if a scavenge goes bad and you get a guy killed, the game will automatically save before you can quit and retry. Save your time and get rebuild 2, its much better.\\n\\nThis game is boring, has almost no content, and lacks the ability to manually save and reload. also, I have no idea how the reviews are almost all positive, this game DOES NOT deserve almost all postive reviews. Reminds me of \"the forest\" another major let down. That game sucked and this game sucks even worse. Thats all I have to say folks!',\n",

Some maps are not loading and crashing the game\\n2. Many people wanted to make nice mods, but unfortunately many generate even more crashes\\n3. No save option during scavenging nor at your base\\n4. Only two songs coming out of the Radio\\n5. During a fight you dont have the feeling you control your character as it can suddenly start walking towards the person you want to shoot, then this person with a knife can kill you instant.\\n6. Character customization regarding their perks and skills has almost no impact on the game. For example the cook doesnt cook better meals so your people need less food to survive or are more happy.. \\n\\nReally wanted to ask my money back but before you know how the game can be played with a lot of bug work arounds, you are over your 2 hours refund period.',\n",

       "  'review': 'It\\'s a decent game, but it has significant problems. The setting is interesting, focusing on the survival of ordinary civilians during a city under siege, inspired by real life Sarajevo, if I understand it correctly. The game is kinda bleak, but I didn\\'t really find it depressing, it\\'s rather you managing to make a cozy little shelter in a rough place, at least once you\\'ve figured out the mechanics. My favourite feeling was managing the temperature at a decent 16 degrees during the cold wave.\\n\\nThe presentation works well, they sell the bleak setting with simple but pretty graphics. The story of each character is kinda basic and didn\\'t quite grab me, though.\\n\\nThe place where the game falls apart is in the mechanics. The game is a survival game with crafting and rougelite elements: The core gameplay loop is you building stuff during the day, and sending one person to scavenge during the night. You can\\'t reload earlier saves (I mean, I\\'m sure you can do some save file shenanigans, but it\\'s not the intended way to play) and the game randomizes content. You manage the usual survival aspects: mental and physical health, hunger, thirst, sleep, temperature. All good stuff.\\n\\nThere are some merits to the survival mechanics, usually I find that there are way too much focus on managing a huge number of bars, here it feels a bit more relaxed. However, the game falls apart a bit in the execution. I won\\'t spoil the specifics, but there is definitely a best way to play, where you basically can ignore any real randomness and do more or less the same thing each time. This defeats the core principles of a good rougelite, where the challenge is doing the best with the assets you\\'re dealt, and makes the gameplay similar, and offering little reason to replay it. And since the developers obviously intend you to replay it, giving you different starting characters to unlock, it must be seen as a bit of a failure on their part. \\n\\nOther issues is the game length, once your shelter is up and running, there is little incentive to do much more than play it safe and wait out the siege, and so the final part of the game feels tedious, and winning a foregone conclusion, and while I haven\\'t clocked it, I would say that this part streches for easily an hour, maybe more. \\n\\nBut before you\\'ve figured out the optimal strategy the game is a lot more interesting, and unless you look at a faq, it might take a while to find it. So if this game seems interesting to you, feel free to give it a try. I don\\'t regret my purchase at all, so my \"thumbs down\" should be more seen as \"read up on it before you buy\" than \"avoid\".',\n",

I'll recommend to get this game if it's heavily discounted (70% or more).  If you can get Boris from the beginning, micromanaging and the grind of gathering supplies can be easier since he has double the amount of inventory space.  After couple of runs and you establish familiarity and strategy, the game gets easy and managing food and medical supply (I fed them only on every other day) easily manageable.  When you start upgrading and making/finding weapons, if you have Roman, you can infiltrate hostile environment by either sneaking and killing your enemies ala ninja style or just straight gang buster style. (Spoiler alert) After 60+ days, if you are able to find the guy who can get you and your party out for 8-9 diamonds, the game is over and thinking about the grind of starting over caused me to not play this since.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"tldr at the end\\nWhen I first played this game several year back I thought It was an interesting take on war but I did not get into it. \\nNow I played a few playthroughs and at first I could not understand the design choices. \\nYou can't move the screen with WASD or arrow keys like every new game since 2000 instead you use right click to drag or holding Left click that's also your move and action key.\\nYou can't remove wood from your fireplace after it has been put in there. But you need to almost daily add one more wood to the fire to relight it after it goes out in the moring. But you cannot take out any wood stacked in there to try to keep the fire going through the night. So if you were foolish enough like me to put all your wood in the fire place you are fucked to be able to cook any food. AND you can't cook food over your fireplace, which is used for heating, at all. You have to use separate wood. If I was in a life/death situation I'd not waste wood like this. I never did in real life either I'd cook breakfast on wood stoves sometimes while I had a gas stove. \\nYou can't move placed furniture which is annoying since every second can matter in this game and if you're like me going for the aethetic look of a survival house you're fucked since the timescale is based on seconds so it takes the same amount of time to cook an entire meal as it takes to walk or run from the attic to basement. \\nThe levels are super small and do not reflect a PC game's ability AT ALL. \\nThe first screen in the game is a split between the base game and the DLC. A basic slap in the face right at the start saying BUY OUR DLC\\nI can't list all the TERRIBLE design choices and flaws in this game. I could not understand any of it at first. But then finally all the pieces came together: only one save for the whole game, the game's finger drag like system converted into right click dragging, little work into making the game deep; This isn't a PC game at all; IT'S A TABLET GAME! I WAS PLAYED LIKE A DAMN FIDDLE\\n\\ntldr: PEOPLE ARE PAYING TWENTY DOLLARY DOOS FOR A HALF FINISHED PHONE GAME!!!! Even with the charity DLC I can't accept this!!!\\n\\nAlso I find it B U L L S H I T that comments are auto disabled anymore.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Lackluster RNG game[/h1]\\n\\nEdit 2019: \\nWas feeling bored and decided to come back to the game, however after 3 in-game days the game bugged and I lost most of my food (I cooked all of it, and the next day, when I tried to send a character to eat, the symbol of 9 food available on the stove changed to 0 and then disappeared), so I gave it another try, feeling a bit bummed out already, and went to the decrepit squad with some food for the hobo, he thanked me and led me to his secret stash with a diamond, as normal, but on the way there he bugged, forgot he had to show me his stash, and went away.... Not only do I hate this game\\'s mechanics, it has also aged like milk, many DLCs to reap some cash, but no bug fixes it seems\\n\\nOld review:\\nI\\'ll try to be quick. This game shields on the fact that its thematic is war, and that it is giving us an insight on how cruel can it be, to be a very low effort game, thus the extremely positive critics of people moved by the game, but not its mechanics. This war of mine is a *very difficult* game, which is always nice but not on this case since the randomness of facts like the loot spawned on the places that you visit, the random chance at night of your survivors being injured or getting sick, the random chance of the trader giving you the items you really need, the random chance of getting new survivors, the random... I think you got the point. Gameplay-wise this game is completely infuriating, more after buying the \"the little ones\" DLC, where you grow more attached to the characters and want to see them live on this unfair, RNG based game.. Leaving the RNG part, the gameplay also is very repetitive, many nights you will need to retry in order to learn the patterns of the NPCs, which will mean that you will also have to repeat the day on which the same keeps happening \"craft, sleep, trade...\", a saving system (which is nonexistent, the game saves automatically once day and that\\'s it) could alleviate this issue. Finally, the combat is very unstable and poorly planted, which means that there\\'s no skill involved, so you\\'ll need to pray to the RNG gods and also retry the night a couple times in order to not get killed\\nI despise this game for reaping so much success off sucking on sensible themes.',\n",

       "  'review': \"All 3 of my characters became broken. Even the guy who went and came back with a full haul of food and material he took from bandits. Someone was knocking at the door for help, but all my guys just stood there staring at walls. I'm done. Raids and moods killed the game for me. It so easy to drop in health/mood but hard as fuck to bring it back to normal. The game should have allowed better options to protect the base. Boarding up one empty spot inside the base isn't the answer. How about allow us to board up the doors or better yet be able to put metal bars on the doors and windows for the kitchen, bathroom, front/back door (You know the areas that really matters). The guy that comes to trade is such a ripoff no matter how you look at it(Even using someone who's good at bartering still makes him a ripoff).\\n\\n..........One year later.\\n\\nEdit: After a year I came back because I was feeling nostalgic towards this game thinking the music and atmosphere was great. Why did I drop this game again? Oh right, because of raids,moods, and combat in general. I wish you could send more ppl out each night to scavenge. I still wish you could board up walls, windows, and doors better. I will definitely not be giving this game any more time. Next time I'm feeling nostalgic, I'll just listen to the soundtrack.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The thing I learned from This War of Mine is that what makes for a compelling statement doesn\\'t always make for a compelling game. I loved the idea the moment I watched the trailer and I don\\'t think I would change anything about the game itself, as every element is designed to convey an important message about war. Games have a long history of glorifying armed conflicts and there are seemingly infinite titles with the word \"war\" in them, and yet even the ones that try to show war for what it is (essentially a rather awful business) sooner or later boil down to action-packed shootouts where every enemy skull cracked open with with a bullet is a little adrenaline-inducing triumph with little time for moral considerations.\\n\\nThis War of Mine is different. It\\'s a tale about trying to survive in inhumane circumstances while retaining some shreds of humanity. Your enemies here are not minions of a ruthless dictator or followers of a murderous ideology that can be lethally dispatched without breaking the comfort of moral superiority. Your enemies here are mundane and impersonal, slowly and inevitably creeping at the characters under your control: hunger, cold, disease and mental breakdown. You also have to fight other human beings, but it\\'s hard to think of them as enemies, as they\\'re also just trying to survive and protect their friends and loved ones, sometimes even at the cost of compromising their morals. And it becomes harder to judge them for it, as the longer you play this game, the more moral compromises will you be forced to make as well, up to the point of making you wonder if you\\'re still one of the good guys.\\n\\nAnd this is how a video game becomes a powerful medium for an important message. War is not guns and glory. War is a set of circumstance that turns people against each other, making moral principles a liability that puts individuals who follow them at a disadvantage. Over time, only those willing to break them get to live another day and condemn another settlement to freezing and starvation by robbing them of vital supplies.\\n\\nSo, why can\\'t I recommend it? Because, while I find every aspect of the game superbly executed, I also find it too overwhelmingly depressing to play. I heard opinions like this before I tried it and it literally couldn\\'t be a better recommendation for me, yet after playing it for just a few hours, I was done with it forever. I know it\\'s not supposed to be fun or exciting, as that would make it just another glorification of war, but the resulting experience is just too offputting for me. No matter how hard you try to get all the supplies you need, your characters are always on the verge of breaking down. No matter how hard you try to be a good guy, at some point the game will make you choose between that and staying alive. And then, as if the game wasn\\'t painfully gut-wrenching enough, the devs added children to it, for crying out loud. I\\'m sorry, I just can\\'t enjoy it in any way or capacity.',\n",

Run in, fill inventory, run home.\\n\\nSetting up and managing a base is also boring. Doing the same things over and over.\\nSince booze is the way to survival there is not much thinking involved,\\nonce the optimal build sequence is know.\\n\\nThe playtime is spent watching the characters run to the next destination, watch progress circles for every action, or waiting for a process to end, since there is no way to speed things up, and loading screens, between night and day cycle.\\n\\nThe stealth in elements in this game are okay, but the boring routine until that point is ruining what could be a good game. \\nThe combat mechanic is not explained, which leads initially to more frustration.\\n\\n\\n+ unique setting\\n+ nice graphics',\n",

Do pills work? How does combat work? Why did my character take damage? There's a lot of lack of clarity, which is supposedly part of the point of the game to depict the complexity of real life and war - which is definitely true, life is not a video game....but a video game IS a video game, and in this format I was just annoyed. I feel this would have worked better as a turn based, not real time, game because a lot of those little annoyances would have been smoothed over.\\n\\nI know the unclear outcomes of your actions are supposed to be part of the theme of hopelessness of war, but I just found it to be an annoying game mechanic.

       "  'review': \"Ok though I liked my time with this game, it suffers from the same fate as so many other games that could have been great. \\n\\nCONCEPT:\\n\\nThis War of Mine is a survival-themed strategy game where the player controls a group of civilian survivors in a makeshift shelter in the besieged, war-torn fictional city of Pogoren, Graznavia. The main goal of the game is to survive the war with the tools and materials the player can gather with the characters they control. Most of the characters under the player's control have no military background or any kind of survival experience, and will require constant intervention by the player in order to stay alive. It is the player's responsibility to maintain their characters' health, hunger and mood levels until the declaration of a ceasefire, which occurs after a randomized duration. (this text taken directly from this games wiki)\\n\\nDuring the daytime, hostile snipers will prevent the survivors from venturing outside, thereby offering the player time to craft tools from gathered materials, trade, upgrade the shelter, cook food and heal the survivors. At night, the player is given the opportunity to venture out and scavenge nearby areas for valuable resources for their everyday survival. During their excursions, the player-controlled survivors can encounter other NPC survivors of the war, who they can choose to help with gifts of food or medicine, or rob and kill. (this text taken directly from this games wiki)\\n\\nThis all sounds impressive and tense, but it really isn't. This game is too easy and predictable. Why?....well I'll tell ya!\\n\\n*Hostile snipers don't really prevent you from going outside as I go outside to help NPC survivers every few day and get back safe.\\n\\n*Night scavenging runs are only dangerous if you venture in areas you have been forwarned are dangerous beforehand! Seriously there is like no randomness that PEACEFUL LUNATIC will attack you, or that behind the church scavenger with a gun will turn on you. If you're not to reckless (and are sneaky) killing armed gunmen with a knife or axe is an EASY, EASY event.\\n\\n*Getting supplies you need, Food, Wood, Parts, Medicine, or Weapons never seems to be a risky or pressing matter like the game leeds you to believe. \\n\\n*Though the learning curve is very harsh in the begining, once you know where to go and what to build first the games an auto win.\\n\\n*The items you MAY really lack can be obtained by a NPC trader that come to YOUR DOOR safely every few days. Where are the snipers then?\\n\\nThis game need randomness, danger and desperation to take it from OK to GREAT and REPLAYABLE.\\n\\nIt needs a chance...like 10% plus 1% added per week that events, or people can go dark and desperate. I'll explain.\\n\\nYou leave the house during the day for NPCS (Above chance) you're wounded or killed by snipers.\\n\\nThe armed scavenger(s) or PEACEFUL LUNATIC(S) (Above chance) try to kill you.\\n\\nThe NPC that come to you're door and join you as PCs (Above chance) are LYING!!! Trying to get into you're house to steal you're food, kill you, or open you're house for night looters. \\n\\n\\nAs is this game is ok at best, buy on 70% off sale like I did. \\n\\nGAME MAKERS...make a THIS GAME IS NO LONGER TOO EASY EDITION or EXPANSION. \\n\\nWhere the game is actually hard. \\n\\nNPC's are desperate and will act eractically.\\n\\nSnipers might shoot you during the day. \\n\\n***You're at least on the right path....just needs alot of work.***\\n\\n\\nNIGHTHATER\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I bought this based on all the positive reviews.... I guess there\\'s no substitution for taste!\\n\\nI\\'d say I don\\'t know what all the fuss is about, but I guess if you\\'re willing to put enough hours in then the gritty reality is quite moving and that\\'s what give it such positive reviews.  Also the graphics and ambience music is good.   BUT THAT\\'S ALL!  Now onto the bad points...\\n\\nIt\\'s boring.  Really boring, dull af.  I managed about half an hour before nodding off and landing in a heap on the floor.  The pace is sooooooo slow.  Exacerbated by the fact that....\\n\\nYou can\\'t save and reload.  I kinda understand the point of rogue-like games - they\\'re purposefully designed to be difficult and cruel to give people a challenge.  That\\'s all well and good when a game is entertaining and challenging (yet relatively quick) but when you\\'re putting hours and hours into dull pointing and clicking (more on this later) and building things and scavaging for resources.  In that case when you screw up due to the completely unavoidable pitfalls of the game, then it\\'s going to be really annoying that you\\'ve lost all that tedious work you\\'d put into it.\\n\\nSo coming back to the controls.  I mean the game literally is just point and click.  There are next to no keyboard shortcuts.  How about just the arrow keys for panning around the screen to save excessive mouse dragging around?  How about being able to number my characters 1,2,3 rather than having to tab-cycle through them each one.  How about even just a shortcut to open your inventory?  The old LucasArts adventure games of 20 years ago had better controls than this!\\n\\nThis is exacerbated by having to do everything manually.  You have to tell people to eat, to cook, to close doors; when you click \"grab all\" when looting, it doesn\\'t clsoe the inventory screen that is an extra step.  Everything about it is long winded, laborious, and monotous.\\n\\nAnd what\\'s more is the 2D thing.  2d games are all well and good when it\\'s implemented effectively, but this isn\\'t.  I couldn\\'t bulid a bed in a perfectly good part of the house because there was a staircase in front of it.... IN FRONT of it.  Why can\\'t I put the bed behind it?  Same again in another room, couldn\\'t place a bed because there was a wardrobe BEHIND it in this case.  Why not just put the bed in front of the wardrobe?  Well leave enough of a gap to open the doors obviously.  It\\'s difficult to explain without seeing but it just feels odd, it means that our little shelter for 3 people is really crammed and short on space, when it looks like a mansion.  A run down mansion obviously, but a big one.  If that was a 3D world/game, you could have about 10 people living in there quite comfortably.   But because the house is apparently only 3 feet in depth (despite the graphics portraying a spacious deep room) we have to scatter our stuff all over a really wide area.\\n\\nPeople say the game really makes you feel the horrors of living and surviving in a war torn country.  That\\'s what I wanted when I bought it.  But the only horror I felt was that of playing a really tedious, slow, and badly designed game.',\n",

I have no words for how many times ive reached 16+ days & exited the game to actually go to sleep or work or have a life & upon return when I load it back up, I cannot continue my game!? I don\\'t like playing games that are this buggy, I got caught out all night in the new Fathers DLC & the second the timer ran out the game crashed!?\\n\\nWhat are you doing dev\\'s? Surely you\\'re not going to let this beautiful game go to shit!? I cant play this for the duration of 1 playthrough in a single sitting & I refuse to leave the game open on my desktop... I\\'m busy utilizing the machine for work purposes (which are CPU & Ram demanding, Sort it the fuck out for the love of humanity!!!\\n\\nEDIT: So I managed a few playthrough\\'s since the mini stealth update you guys sent out but I didnt end up closing or exiting the game... Instead I had to leave it running in the background when not playing, which has been cooking my machine! Still don\\'t trust exiting game for it to not reload later on... You must sort this out dev\\'s as the game has always been a masterpiece, albeit a slightly broken one.\\n\\nFather\\'s Promise DLC was f\"\"\"ing heartbreaking...',\n",

I do have on major complaint about it though and that\\'s the fact that mood and illness overtakes absolutely everything else and frankly it\\'s BS.  For example, Pavle have been \"severely ill\" FOR FORVER.  Seriously makes no sense.  The developers programmed it so even if you\\'re actively medicating and resting and blah blah blah guess what....doesn\\'t matter, he\\'s now gone from severely ill to terminally ill.  It\\'s really annoying but it gets worse, because many of the resources you need to survive already belong to other people....so taking it?  MAKES EVERYONE IN THE MF\\'ING HOUSE DEPRESSED AND IT GOES DOWN HILL FROM THERE.  Seriously you programmers to get your **** straight and cut this nonsense out.  What the hell is the point of making scavenging the core loot process if it does nothing but make everyone unable to do anything?  And don\\'t bother buying into the whole \"brighten their mood\" nonsense, it doesn\\'t work either.  I have a guitar, music, and every possible accommodation and it does jack ****.  This game would have been worth buying if they didn\\'t include this garbage it literally makes the game unplayable beyond the first week because that\\'s when everyone starts going down hill.  Because of this the game is a solid C-',\n",

       "  'review': \"If I could give a neutral review, that would be what I give this game. I have to consider a couple of things when I can't decide whether to give a positive or negative review. What is the normal price? How much fun did I have? Was the experience interesting and/or unique? Did the game run smoothly. Is there replay value?\\n\\nThis game is definitely interesting. If you want to get a sense of what being trapped in a war-ravaged area would be like, then this is a great game. However, the game itself is seldom fun and usually punishing. The challenge is really just trying to survive as long as possible. The problem is that surviving is often a depressing endeavor. There's hardly ever any joy to be had. Even having a drink or a smoke doesn't feel pleasurable. I lasted 25 days, but honestly I just wanted to die during the last 10 days or so. I was kind of sad that I had lastted yet another day by my 23rd day. \\n\\nThere's also a disconnect between you and the protagonists. You may not feel the same way about the moral dilemmas in the game as your character. I know that I did not feel bad at all about stealing from other people when my own life or that of my friends depended on it. There was this old couple that I stole medicine from. The character became depressed after this act. However, I simply saw it as a necessity. It was either them or us. We needed those supplies. \\n\\nMaybe I'm a horrible person. But war makes even devils out of angels. What would you do to save the life of your family and/or friends? Would you steal from an elderly couple to live to see another day? And does playing a game that puts you through those types of ordeals sound fun?\\n\\nWell, the game did run smoothly. I experienced no errors. There is replay value. If I played again, I can see several things I could do differently to improve my chances of survival. However, I have no interest in doing so. I wouldn't want to survive longer in the game. The normal price of $19.99 USD seems kind of high to me for what you're getting. I think the sale price is what the normal price should be. Even then, I'd say this is a $3 experience because you won't want to play it for very long.\\n\\nRate 4.5/10. My advice: try the free to play weekend, you'll know after 1 hour or so whether you really want to buy this game or not. I had already bought the game, so it's too late for me. \\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is very well done. It takes you deep into the atmosphere of the scenery. \\n\\nThe problem: It is not fun. A game like this is not supposed to BE fun, I get that, but it should MAKE fun. This game does not. Your characters are not only always under some condition (sick, wounded, tired, sad) they are also moving around in the house in a very slow pace. This sounds like a strange thing to mention but in fact it puts the icing on the cake. While it could be fun to find out what is worth to go for (like producing lots of alcohol or cigarettes to exchange for food or to go for producing food to exchange for materials) you just do not get the time for that because your characters are always not fully operational and/or always need supplies you just don´t have which leads to even more problems which are stalling any progress in building up the house. So what I see most of the time is characters lying in bed recovering from some condition while one character is crawling through the house doing one or two things before materials lacking again.\\n\\nThis is a slow and depressing game. I tried two times but stopped playing both times after a few weeks in-game time. I am sure if you try really hard you will get things done but, HELL, a GAME is supposed to make FUN! If I want to chew on a piece of wood I can get one for free, I don´t need to pay 19 € for it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'While it is an interesting concept I felt the execution suffered. Game mechanics held little meaning for me. I felt that it didnt really matter if I upgraded my workshops and other items such as the stove. I could just cheese my way through the game. Also, the enemy AI is really weird. One minute im sneaking in, then they see me and say Hi come trade, only to blast my guys head off if I start sneaking off again. Additionally, once they spot you its very hard to evade them, they seem to be able to track your movement even if you arent in their line of sight and change floors, they inexplicably change floors as well to meet you. I faced a few bugs, nothing major but nonetheles. Poorly written speech bubbles which dont make sense. For example, saying \"Good thing I got my saw with me\" when I dont have one in possession, there were some other quirks with the speech bubbles youll notice. \\n\\nIf you do something negative, like steal or kill someone, you become depressed. Not sure how that affects the game. All I remember was a gloomy pallete accompanied by depressing speech bubbles. I know the game is trying to convey that war is grim and full of horrors and that may be the purpose but that doesnt make it fun to play. If we are looking at surivival mechanics it reminds me of a poorly done \"dont starve\". \\n\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is a difficult game to write a review about at all. Ever since its release, it\\'s gathered such a crazy that the \"consequences\" for saying something bad rivals Darkest Dungeon. It\\'s not that this is a particularly bad game but it has the usual rogue-like schtick attached to it.\\n\\nThe story is what gathered a lot of attention, from my understanding. Ignoring the rumours about how exaggerated the comparison is to the real life events, it\\'s a pretty good concept regardless. You control a group of unlucky survivors that are stuck in a war-zone, unable to escape because both rebels and army will kill them if they attempt to. From what I understand, this game goes on forever until you lose all of your survivors. I\\'ve never been one to take most themes used in video games too seriously so this game didn\\'t make me feel depressed. Maybe more melancholy but I can only assume that by \"depressing\" most people are referring to the way that the game works and how it causes a feeling of depression, or alternatively empathy for people in a shitty situation.\\n\\nThe gameplay isn\\'t as great as you\\'d expect from a survival-base-managing game. Essentially the day-to-night process of each day goes as such :\\n\\n1) Wake up and perform tasks at base(building/upgrading facilities, refueling fire, eating, sleeping, medicine and or bandages, speaking to visitors / trader, etc.)\\n\\n2) End the day or wait until the timer ticks away. You then hit the night prep phase in which you choose what each person does, from a selection of scavenge(1 person per night), sleep(on a bed or on the floor) and guard.\\n\\n3) Night phase in which you either didn\\'t send anyone to scavenge(in which case see step 1 and repeat) or you sent someone to scavenge. The scavenging phase consists of you moving around an area and, depending on where you are, you\\'re either save to go busting through doors like an action movie star and yelling at people to barter with you or you are sneaking around not trying to be 1HKO\\'d by someone with a gun. I *think* you need to leave before the timer ends or else you lose your character, but I\\'ve never waited to see.\\n\\nPretty basic process. Step 1 has no real issues because a lot of its issues come from the rest of the game. Step 2, the night prep phase, is a nightmare depending on the situation. I had someone who was lethally wounded, and no matter what they would *not* heal. I had them sleeping every night for a good 7 or so days and bandaging when I could. This stems from the fact that there\\'s a consistent degradation of 1 \"level\" of status per day, so if you\\'re out of bandages and you\\'re not finding 1 bandage per night, you\\'re absolutely screwed. This also messes up your night prep because, in my experience, you\\'ll eventually need 2 people to guard even if you have patched up all the holes in your home. There\\'s also a managing of who does what when. If you have people guard during the night, they need to rest the next night or during the following day, meaning you have to have x amount of beds, x being the amount of people who will be tired from guarding + the scavenger. This especially becomes an issue when someone is sick or wounded becase if they don\\'t rest, their sickness/wound gets worse. You also need to guard every night because, from what I gathered in every single one of my runs, the raids are completely RNG randomized as to whether not they happen each night.This plus the taken sleep slot(s) and your game essentially spirals into a deep dark hole if you\\'re unlucky. Basically, it\\'s painfully exhausting to manage it while also combatting an issue in phase 3.\\n\\n...And that brings us to aforementioned phase 3. Let\\'s just get this out there : This game is fueled by RNG. It\\'s a roguelike and, even if roguelikes didn\\'t exist off of rng, this game would not exist without it. That\\'s an awful fact that you have to deal with when playing this game. It just is not and NEVER will be a fun mechanic to play against but the issue is that this game runs off of it as a required mechanic. In phase 3, you explore the selected scavenging location and you go around nabbing at whatever you can get your hands on in the many spots you can search. I think all characters have 10 or 12 inventory slots, except for one character in one of the starter group setups. I never found anything that could increase inventory limit, so as far as I\\'m concerned you\\'re stuck with a pretty small inventory. Aside from location-specific story loot, I can only assume that loot is randomized upon the *first* entry of the map and I\\'ve had times where I\\'ve searched a few containers and only found a SINGLE item in the container, meaning I got 1 item from that search. Not one item with a stack of 3, but a single individual item(I think it was water which is a pathetic enough result to cause a ragequit). This is an inherent issue of RNG and, honestly, it persists throughout the entire game so much so that if you\\'re looking for certain items to make any kind of progress, you probably won\\'t even clear out every area unless you get cold feet and don\\'t want to venture into dangerous locations. So, yeah, the RNG loot is fucking ass. \\n\\nThe combat is pretty bad too but it\\'s mostly because you can only ever send one person out to scavenge. Presumably because controlling more than one person would be too difficult and to make the game really difficult in general. Without body armour, a shotgun takes 2 hits to kill you, a pistol 3-4~, and an assault rifle burst 1 hit. Even being punched by enemies, I had a character go to near-death in about 5 or so hits. It\\'s pretty fucking asinine if you ask me and it just serves to pad the game. I had to restart a lot of times because if a character dies, it completely fucks up your game. Not only is it really rare to have a survivor visit your base, it takes away an extra survivor to sub in for scavenge or guarding as well as base-maintaining. It also causes severe happiness issues to the point you might as well just restart. There is a good thing about combat, though. You can insta-kill enemies with a melee weapon if they\\'re right in front of you when you\\'re hiding. This, however, causes depression. 2 kills in a single night caused my survivor to break, meaning you can\\'t control them and they\\'re essentially comatose. I assume eventually your survivors get used to it, but I had killed several people and they *still* wouldn\\'t stop bitching about it as if it was their first kill. Your survivors even have a happy thought if you kill bandits and yet the one who kills them still gets severe happiness loss. Shouldn\\'t there be reduced happiness drop if you\\'re killing a bad person? It\\'s not like killing someone drives you insane. Honestly, it\\'s a really unbalanced consequence considering how the late-game locations are extremely dangerous and sneaking around is pretty difficult. \\n\\nThat\\'s more or less the gist of the phase 3 stuff. Terrible RNG consistently screwed me over in terms of loot, to the point that I had to keep on restarting until I would actually get enough food and materials to make any kind of progress, and it\\'s incredibly easy to go stagnant in this game. A game where food is extremely limit but materials aren\\'t and you just never have enough inventory space or even enough food to do 5 trips to the same location.\\n\\nThe game isn\\'t terrible, it\\'s just that I personally found it to be extremely unbalanced and unfair. Maybe that was the point because, hey, war is unfair and you should totally implement that as a \"feature\" in a game! The game is just painfully difficult and exhausting to play and, when it comes down to it, it\\'s mostly because of RNG ruling the hell out of this game. The same issues that exist in Darkest Dungeon exist in this game as per its genre. You consistently get shitty loot? Restart, because loot doesn\\'t refresh and you sure as hell aren\\'t going to get a break. Why play a doomed game when you can restart over and over until you eventually get that perfect game?',\n",

       "  'review': 'First off, I\\'ll link you to a review that I have found expressed the vast majority of my own problems with the game: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198801447804/recommended/282070/\\n\\nWith that out the way, I would like to add to that and say that, first off, I have found the DLC to be complete and utter dissapointments with even less quality put into them than the main game. I haven\\'t played them, but I have watched some gameplay and read some reviews, enough to see how far the DLC go. This game has some pretty good ideas behind it, but I have to say that...\\n\"[its] execution deserves execution\", as certain somebody expressed about another game.\\n\\nI really hate the fact that the UI is so in-your-face when it doesn\\'t have to be. You could have your cursor hovered over something to get the bubble pop up instead or have your cursor change texture to indicate an action for something in particular.\\n\\nAside from the game\\'s bugs, the mechanics are really undeveloped, scenario wise. Here\\'s some ways that I think could certainly improve the game:\\n\\n* SO MUCH missed potential with events; some parts are blocked off. In one of the houses, a door is blocked by a bath that you CAN\\'T REMOVE! For some reason everything isn\\'t deconsctructable/hackable, which would make sense to be possible to do, I mean, if you see a TV or empty a fridge, woudn\\'t it make sense to deconstruct them for parts and specifically mechanical partsinstead of finding that shit only in rubbles, shelves and FUCKING WARDROBES, WHO KEEPS ELECTRONICS IN A WARDROBE?! Imagine being able to lay a ladder somewhere to get down, or being actually able to eat/take pills/ apply bandages WHILE scavenging. It would free up a slot and would actually make sense if your scavenging character has needs catered to. Such dumb!\\n\\n* Doors blocked off with wooden bars should be, but for some stupid reason are not HACKABLE WITH A HATCHET! Like WHY CAN\\'T I HACK A DOOR?! It seems like the perfectly logical and game-balanced way to do this.\\n\\n* Actually NOT have +2 upgrades for the table, and instead may be just have 1?\\n\\n* You know how you can be raided by thugs during the night? How about making that less predictable so I don\\'t get a sense of knowing when to put more of my guard on or not. Moreover, what about putting in effort for creating scenarios of defending your own house as well? \\n\\n* Homeless... how are the people inhabiting certain uildings possible to call homeless when they have a shelter? They may be poor, poorer than you (or not, if you have fuck all left for resources to a point of being screwed, in which case, what\\'s the difference between you, them, and any other average survivor?), but not homeless, unless they\\'re nomading because they can\\'t find a decent shelter, which doesn\\'t happen; the \"homeless\" that you find in one place at one point you\\'ll see there all the time, they don\\'t move! So how can you call them homeless? It also brings me to my next point, which is...\\n\\n* Things in places you\\'ve visited before almost completely DON\\'T CHANGE. Kill a thug, you\\'d expect the other thugs to be more alert that time, may be even try to track you, increasing your chance of being raided and attacked relentlessly, but NOPE! But even if it did...\\n\\n* Your characters NEVER kill ANYONE that raids your house. There isn\\'t any type of hostage system in the game either! At best, you just waste some ammo, at worst you\\'ll lose items, which I have not had happen to me at all. Honestly, considering how easy it is for you to rob other places, shouldn\\'t it be about just as easy for others . This huge difference in mechanics from your playable characters and game-play mechanics with other NPCs and implied scenarios are completely dumbfounded  with huge differences in how they function, even conceptually, to a point where it doesn\\'t feel like you\\'re in a world of actual war as an insignificant citizen, trying to survive war right by your doorstep, but more like your characters are the cliched protagonists of the given \"story\" you\\'re presented with.\\n\\n* Going out scavenging you can only have ONE character. There\\'s no AI for another character to help you out and carry more stuff back, while your house keeps getting raided by multiple people, based on the dialogue after being raided, or any co-op mode to compromise for it in any way.\\n\\n* How is an intruder coming in and trying to rob you a \"raid\"? Wouldn\\'t a raid need to have you having lost something from the robbery? It would be such an easy distynction to make, but instead the game makes you worried for a second for you then to realise that they didn\\'t steal anything, nothing really happened and you just lost some bullets.\\n\\n\\nThere is a reason why I am saying all of this here, in a review and not as suggestions in the discussion forum; it\\'s because I, and everybody else knows that developers won\\'t do shit to improve the game except may be try to fix some glitches IF you give them your save file. They don\\'t give a fuck! They found a way to make a good mula and they put in the effort to make an excuse for it, not actually present a well-crafted experience, not even with the Father\\'s Promise DLC, which has old dialogue that makes no sense in context of the sotry; \"\"We manage to fend them off this time, but I\\'m afraid they\\'re just testing our defences\" - Adam. WHO ARE THE \"WE\"?! You\\'re the only sad fucker in your house you nitwhit, and there\\'s NOBODY guarding it, who tf are you blaming it on?! And how is your house still not robbed, consindering NOBODY\\'s guarding it?! Dialogue is dumb. Grammatical errors and such are certainly forgivable, but dialogue in general is little to none and doen\\'t reflect personality of characters at all, it\\'s all the same for all of them, except for their bios... WHICH, btw, don\\'t reflect situations well either; if a character falls severely ill and you have meds everyone will whine about them needing to FIND meds, not that they just need to give them to the ill character, and may be also get the heating going if that\\'s part of the cause, but to GET them... problem is, they HAVE meds, have had meds for a while, and I\\'m just not giving any because the heater isn\\'t on or I was trying to preserve the meds for a bad day and let the character take the cheaper pills instead.',\n",

First playthrough botched because of this.\\n\\n2)For some reason it starts automatically with the second story, instead of giving you the option to choose between each one. That or it's random.\\n\\n3)Bugs and random CTD. Some NPCs get stuck in certain places, without returning to their original position. Items disappearing or changing(?). \\n\\nCTD are the worst. Aside from random CTD in a certain timeframe, I am stuck now because I need to visit the airport to get loot, but it crashes everytime I start to scavange there. 28 days in, and it's either that or stealing from elders, or innocent families.\\n\\n4)Even if we ignore the above, and agree to the fact that it's atmospheric. Overall it's kinda meh. The whole despair in war, even though logical, is kinda meh. Who I can and can't kill isn't clear, aside from obvious location descriptions (or rather only 1 afaik).\\nTo counter a few shortcomings I installed mods for better stacking and tool durability, plus more items, which shocks me to think how bad the game is without them. But then come things which mods can't fix.\\n \\n-Depression is the same dialog for everyone, including cheering up.\\n-Can't visit neighbors and help them at any time I want.\\n-No multi-scavengers at one time different locations and/or together. (Bandit's attack in groups, why can't we?)\\n-No overnight working on production/cooking/building etc.\\n-No personal character inventory/backpack equipment and upgrades.\\n-No holding people at gunpoint(with a gun or melee weapon) for ransom or control (While we steal).\\n-No control over characters addicitions, can't control their coffee, cigs intake/amount.\\n-Controls are stupid - No keyboard control/support and mapping. \\n-Can't drag dead bodies out of the way.\\n-No traps for home defense. A simple barbed wire or tripwire mine.\\n\\nAnd I think I can add more, but I won't. I would've closed my eyes, but such small things piled up and these are just from the top of my head.\\n\\nIs the game interesting - yes. But unlike other indie games, I would play what it and mods offer and forget about it, and possibly never touch again. That is the sad, unfortunate thing I discovered.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I know my review is not like the many others.  Let me preface by saying that the atmosphere and concept of this game is pretty unique.  \\n\\nOverall I did not enjoy it, and it was not fun to play for me.  Perhaps it\\'s because I\\'m just not a fan of survival games in general, however this one seemed a little more intriguing.\\n\\nI really tried to give this game a chance and played it for several hours because I wanted to like it.  The first few hours I spent trying to get used to the game mechanics after trying to figure it out on my own with no \"how to get started\" guide.  \\n\\nOnce I sort\\'ve figured out how to play, after dying and having to start over from the beginning (not fun, very frustrating), I then found the game repetitive and unrewarding.  I was expecting a story progression and there really was none.  While the graphics and mood kept me engaged for a while, it ultimately left me disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did.\\n',\n",

It succeeds at creating a dark, tense, heavy emotional atmosphere. The sombre sounds, the bleak art style. I think it’s important for people to see war in this light. But I just didn’t like the gameplay. It gets repetitive. Do your chores to build equipment during the day and get your characters to eat and sleep. Then choose one, and only one person to go scavenge at night. You can carry so little that you end up dragging a bit of debris back to your base to build up one more thing, or finally get a meal into your characters. And it’s so easy to die! And when a character dies that’s it. Their story just stops. You play with whoever is left but you feel that deep impact of a person’s story just being… over. Prematurely. \\nThe game does those things very well. But after a couple of tries I got to a point where I just wanted to be done with it and wasn’t enjoying the gameplay of it anymore.

Gameplay is on a mobile game level. A lot of waiting is involved, those workstation upgrades and everything is for me annoying. Simply watching someone else playing the game (with the waiting part cut out) would be better. How saving is being handled is also annoying. The game saves namely at the end of the night. So If you play in small chunks of time it's very annoying, and every time you have to quit you have to start the day from the beginning. \\n\\nI hope this game will give some ideas to other developers and hope it will be remembered as first one of this sub-genre, but it's simply not something I would expect from a pc game.\",\n",

Not (only) by creating that atmosphere but also by making you annoying repetitive and sometimes useless tasks over and over again. Some of the levels have a little story to tell - nice - but 95% of the time you run around looting and cooking food and sleeping and looting and cooking and sleeping and...\\n\\nNeedless to say that everything looks the same.\\n\\nSo what I want to say is: If you want to personally feel the depressing reality for civilians in a war - go get that game.

It comes with an array of different characters and scenarios to play and evolve their stories and for that it gets points for replayability as well as diversity. When it comes to actual gameplay, however, even after several years since the games release it feels unresponsive and slow to play and this can lead to unfair punishment for the player and sometimes it gets downright boring because it feels more like a chore than something enjoyable.

When that happens, you have lost the game, there is no way to fix it. You need to start the new game, but that one will not save either.\\n\\nNow, bugs do happen, right, and companies fix them and all is good. Some of the games I liked a lot were released as a mess and were patched later. However this particular company is not interested in fixing bugs. They are more interested in releasing new versions of the games on tablet, phones and pocket watches. This particular bug is obviously game breaking and there were 4 of us reporting identical problem on their OFFICIAL forums. They never replied to any of us. Literally bug was reported, it was reported 4 months later again, it was reported 3 months after that by another person etc. Not even a post of acknowledgement, let alone willingness shown to work on fixing the bug.\\n\\nThis developer should not be supported, it's the worst this industry has. My motivation for posting this negative review is not raging in public or even punishing the developer. After all, it's been years since I've had this bad experience. I want to get rid of companies that offer zero support after release, not showing even an interest in fixing game breaking bugs. We want to support good business practices instead.\",\n",

In a city, but that\\'s not why I\\'m giving it a negative review.\\nFor a game that brags about being so \"realistic\" it has way too many flaws and is lacking in many areas. People act unnaturally, motivation is non-existent, charecters are just weak.\\nSome things are just stupid like why you have nothing to burn? You have a tree in the backyard, with a freaking wooden house on it, plus a whole lot of wooden furniture, but nah, let\\'s freeze. Not to mention those eternal fires that burn in the scene... and no cannibalism, like really? Oh yeah it\\'s gross, but in real wars it did happen. People would also eat grass and even tree bark and other stuff - just to survive you know. But our crying boys in this game won\\'t accept anything less than a real canned food.\\nIt feels like the game was made based on survival knowledge of some typical city dwelling hypocrite that can only imagine what he would do if he was REALLY hungry, but he never ever felt it, nor he was ever freezing to death, so he had to invent all this crappy limitations. God forbid you burn that wardrobe.. I could go on forever.\\nGameplay wise the game is simply a boring grind.\\nP.S. sorry for typos, I\\'m too angry to check what I type',\n",

       "  'review': \"Meh, constantly out of food. Cant ever seem to get ahead. Every enemy has a gun, and I still haven't been lucky enough to randomly scavange the right pieces to make one. Even if you do feel like you're finally ahead on something you're severly lacking in other areas. For example I finally saved up enough food for 2-3 days, but then had no weapons and lost most of my food and water from raids because I didn't have weapons. Putting someone on guard is pointless, I seriously did it 8 nights in a row and got robbed on 6 of them lol. Starting back pack with 10 spaces is entirely too small. I guess maybe if you were a single scavenger for yourself, but you're forced onto a 3 man team.  And WHY CAN I CARRY 10 BOTTLES OF WATER IN A SINGLE BACK PACK SLOT, BUT ONLY 2 STICKS IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF SPACE. Just doesnt add up. Also why wouldn't each scavenger be able to go on their own solo mission at night time. Or let me send 2 out and one has to stay or something. I can force them to sleep on the floor instead of a bed, but not to go on a mission if some one else is also out and about. Just seems lame. I mean especially since when i put a guy on guard duty and it says we get robbed anyways... like why the fuck couldn't he have just been out scavenging. At least then after getting robbed I come back with some items.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"On the surface, this game appears to offer a space for the player to make their own moral decisions given a difficult situation. However, every player-controllable character in the game has their own thoughts and feelings about everything and the player is punished for making decisions which are in conflict with them.\\n\\nThis is taken from the store page:\\n“Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.“\\n\\nThe game does not play out this way. You’ll be continuously guilted for deviating from the game’s own rules of morality and your group will become depressed and hard to control.\\n\\nAlso, the range of decisions available to you is extremely limited. So far, every encounter I’ve had with a “hostile” npc results in one of us dying or severely wounded no matter what (unless I run from them). Here’s an example: In one area, I peeked though a door to see there was a soldier sitting in the room. I knew he was armed with a handgun, but I was armed with an assault rifle. He wasn't in a defensive stance, so I open the door and point my weapon at him, thinking this will trigger some kind of stand off, but he just stands up, pulls out his gun, and shoots me. So I put three rounds in him, he stumbles for a second and I stop shooting. He recovers, takes aim for about a second, then shoots me again, so I put three more in him and he dies. And somehow, having been shot twice (with no body armor), I’m only slightly wounded…\\n\\nTo me, there’s a mismatch between the actual core gameplay and what is being marketed. And without interesting and ambiguous moral conflict, the survival aspects by themselves are grindy and uncompelling. Definitely disappointed.\",\n",

It has a myriad of desperate human struggles in war time, so as you can imagine there are some compelling stories to be unearthed as you progress in the game.\\n\\nMy game is experiencing incessant bugs that are blocking any progress. Randomly minimizes the game to desktop, where it will be completely frozen. I cant do anything to get out of it, task manager wont open, cant even sign out or close the game. Ive had the game for maybe 3 hours and I have had to do a hard reset 4 times now. This is really irritating.\\n\\nHowever this is without a doubt one of the best games released these past few years. I just couldn't get myself to taint its stellar reviews on steam due to a bug. I bought this game awhile ago on GOG and have poured maybe 100 hours into this game. High replay value. \\n\\nedit: It breaks my heart to do this but Im putting it as negative because my game freezes my entire system every 20 minutes. Its getting ridiculous, and its extremely irritating having to lose progress due to this.\",\n",

I had no desire to play for the third time.\\n\\nThe idea is nice but the execution if flawed. It gets really boring and really tedious mid-game, and despite everything I just couldn't feel anything or identify with any of the characters.\\nIt's a bloody war, people die, and you have your own survival at stake. You need to be tough and do things. I don't care about bandits, elderly couples or other people. I'll rob them and kill them if necessary to ensure my own people survive. But then this guy gets all so emotional and starts going batshit crazy. Maybe I'm just dead inside but once I got to this point I almost turned it off with disgust. Yeah, you killed them, get over it, this is brutal reality, not a fairy tale.\\n\\nThe crafting aspect is flawed. You only have some basic crafting system which is completly unimaginative and it takes a lot of time. The gathering part is tedious and drawn out and also takes a lot of time during which you can't do anything else. The most interesting thing is probably the very beginning where you have nothing and need to gather stuff and set up but even that suffers from the aforementioned flaw. After you're done with it after couple of nights there is really nothing more to do. It turns from survival into waiting game until the war is over.\\n\\nOn a sale - maybe, otherwise - pass.\",\n",

It's just that the start seems ultra grindy and for some reason the deaths are a lot more game breaking than say those in the game Shelter (which plays almost the same). This means you will generally play for an hour or so and manage to get the basics going and upgrade your workshops to the first level only to lose a survivor to enemies that totally outmatch them and from there its a slow downhill slide. Random and recurring illnesses don't help and escaping wounded with a few weapon parts and the odd bit of food and medication simply isn't worth the outlay that treating (and often re-treating) said wounds can cause. In practice this makes any attempt to continue after a nasty scavange will only lead to a prolonged glide into oblivion so you will find yourself quiting the second anything particularly bad happens or resorting to scum saves. If the physical dangers alone weren't enough then you will not be best pleased that most of the characters in the game turn manic depressive or alcholic at the drop of a hat (or robbing of a pensioner).\\n\\nIt's all deliberately dark but, for me, that also makes it not fun to play.

       "  'review': 'Not sure if it is okay to review something that makes itself to be a work of art, but as a game, this software is not fun. The first couple game days are spent fixing up a huge house, and I would have rather actually fixed up a house, because watching black-and-white characters walking s-l-o-w-l-y to clean up a pile of rubble was painful. I figured out how to convert building material into fuel (no tutorial) and make a little food, so one of the three starting characters could eat, since they start out with an illness. Then, in the next morning, the other two characters were hungry, with no more fuel left to use. Woo-hoo. Took forever to do nothing. I guess this is a commentary on war? Suppose I should have remembered other games that tried to put the social narriative before the game mechanics... they were decidedly un-fun.\\n\\n(Update) Tried this game again on a different computer. Frankly, I was looking for the trading card drops. But it occurs to me now that the slowness of the game is actually a problem with the graphics. I looked at the Tech Support Forum here, and sure enough I see other LINUX users complaining of slow performance with their games, too. This explains it! I thought everyone was shuffling slowly because they were so depressed about the war.',\n",

       "  'review': 'First of all I have to say that it\\'s great seeing a company trying to be charitable through their game. This lack of recommendation does not necessarily reflect on the quality of the game.\\n\\nI played This War of Mine for only a few hours(1-2) before I got bored of it and uninstalled. After a while I thought about the praise this game is getting for it\\'s depiction of war not only showing a side of it that is not fun à la Call of Duty with heavy moral choices but also showing it from the perspective of civilians instead of soldiers. That said it did not manage to engage me at all. After an additional 3 hours I realised something: Nothing was going to happen. Of course there would be some events that would impact the characters but I felt quite disconnected from them so I did not really care what happened to them before the siege of the city ended. And that\\'s it, the siege would end the conclusion and the message of the game are practically spelled out from the start. Combine that with a lack of connection with the characters and the only thing that remains is mechanics.\\n\\n\\nThe only reason I see to play this game assuming you have consumed art with a similar narrative is the mechanics. If you enjoy the type of game it is or just want to know if you can beat it then buy it.\\n\\n\\nThere is more one could talk about with this game in mind like \"fun as a necessity in games\", the \"depiction of war in media\" and more specifically \"gamefying war\" but I\\'d like to end this review with a link instead.\\nIf you feel like my review(or that of anyone else) discouraged you from buying this game but you would still like to be charitable this is organization that worked 11 bit studios: http://www.warchild.org/\\nYou can donate there.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Now I don't have the rest of the DLC for the game so I'm going to base my review off of the base game. \\n\\nThis review you'll be reading is coming from a person who thinks that Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout New Vegas are better than any other Fallout or Elder Scrolls game to date, that CS:GO is really just Counter Strike with better graphics and doesn't have any other redeeming qualities, that the Borderlands series of FPS games are really repetitive and boring, have really bad humor and should've never ever have existed in the first place. Now onto my opinion about this game.\\n\\nTo be honest, the game's a bit dissappointing. The game get's really boring once you figure out how all the game mechanics work and I did in just 4 hours and it all seems repetitive now but not because of trying to survive everyday of course, characters feel bland even with their own journals/opinions towards the player's decisions on events and they seem to share much of the same dialogue the rest of the whole game, the game also is a bit buggy even after all these years such as random crashes after revisiting a location you haven't been in a long time, NPCs not functioning properly such as being too late or failng to tell you that the area is off limits then immediately become hostile towards you, NPCs becoming hostile for no reason(Although this is rare and has only happened to me twice), also the base game only has 1 map for some reason. Overall I wouldn't recommend this game even with the  many different endings you can come out with based on your decisions as the Player and the ability to make your own customized playthrough. I'd rather much get something else than this game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It is a lot of fun, but there is a lot of shit that's broken. The devs have acknowledged issues with the achievement system for the DLC and there are a lot of things in the game that are bugged. Bugs I have personally experienced include, but are not limited to the following:\\n-Not being able to unlock particular achievements even though I have met the criteria\\n-Being penalized for killing military soldiers (there is a morality system that influences your characters and it penalizes you for making immoral decisions, though you are not meant to be penalized for killing military soldiers)\\n-Being penalized for stealing from thugs (though you can avoid being penalized by returning the day after you kill them, for which I have also been penalized for at times)\\n-I've been attacked by civilians at the church for digging up a pile of refuge (I was certainly surprised when the priest came after me from halfway across the map)\\n-I have not personally experienced it, although there is confirmation that you are able to steal from some civilians without moral penalty\\n-I returned once to my game and one of my characters was no longer listed in the lower right corner along with the others and one of the characters was depressed and implicated that the other died in the night. This was strange because another character was saying that she wished she could feed him, and I had received no actual notification telling me that he had died\\n-I once backstabbed an enemy and after killing him and looting his body I ran into his adversaries and to my surprise, he rose right the fuck back up and shot me\\nI can enjoy the game, but the bugs make it extremely frustrating at times. I have a lot of hours put into this game and am really disappointed that the devs haven't fixed so many of the bugs that are still present. I'm most certainly not the only one who has experienced these bugs either; a lot of these, along with others, are confirmed on the wiki. If these bugs were fixed, I could recommend it, but the game still feels like it is in beta in all honesty.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Walk into a hospital. A soldier tells you to behave yourself, so you violently chop up the chair he’s currently sitting on for firewood, then sell it back to the nearest doctor. Then you go home and build a guitar using only wood, gears, and a broken guitar. \\n\\nI really like what this War of Mine is trying to do, but I’m not a fan of the execution. The game centers around resource management and crafting in the style of civilians trapped in a city under siege. As you fight to survive, you’ll have to build beds, make alcohol, gather firewood, and scrounge the ruined cities. \\n\\nCharacters are well developed through their updating bios, Bruno especially. The game has a striking somber tone and grey scale art style which is especially wonderful to see during the winter scenarios. However, I think the most tragic thing about the game is the pacing. A typical story lasts 45 in game days. That’s a long time when there\\'s only a maximum of 24 scavengable locations and most of those will be inaccessible at any given time due to either a raging battle or snow. \\n\\nThe war in This War of Mine doesn\\'t actually effect the game that much. Sure, there are locations guarded by soldiers. Sure, you can hear shells in the ambience. But bandits and snow are a far greater threat than anything the military in this game has to offer. Shells will never hit your house and break your defenses. Battles will never occur outside your shelter. Rebel fighters will never hold you up at gunpoint for supplies as all attacks on your shelter happen off screen. Without some context to ground the player in the setting of an ongoing civil war, the game might as well be set immediatley after a nuclear apocalypse because the ongoing battle on its own has no meaning. This War of Mine isn\\'t your war at all.\\n\\nThe point is that once you get past the game’s unique premise, there’s not a lot to do. Once you have your essentials and are generating some tradable items, you can skip most of your time in the shelter. The difficulty curve is initially a sharp climb because you don’t know what to expect. Once you know what locations need what item and which items are the most useful, the difficulty curve hits freefall at terminal velocity. The result is that you have everything you need to survive and trade with around Day 20 and then have nothing to do for the remaining 25 days. Once I realized this, I decided to raid army strongholds just for fun. \\n\\nI wish I had more to say, but overwhelmingly I was just bored. Returning from scavenging was always the same. Send tired people to bed, feed someone, make moonshine, see if trader will show up, skip to night, repeat. The scavenging can throw a few curveballs with enemies and a tiny inventory, but that just wasn’t enough to keep me engaged. I appreciate what this game is trying to do and the message it sends, but as a game I think it falls short.\\n\\nStrong game design is about short term goals and long term goals. ExamIple from Monopoly: My long term goal is to make other players bankrupt. To do that, I\\'m going to buy this property at all costs. \\nThis War of Mine asks you to make your own short term goal (what supplies you need) and also your long term goal (finishing the game). The game provides no hints about when its ending is coming or how to achieve it until the late game. This leaves players stranded around the half way point as they have no overarching task to complete. All you can do is wait and continue to amass a dragon\\'s hore of supplies. This uncomfortable lull makes the game feel like a cheap mobile app rather than a cohesive interactive experience. There\\'s another way to complete the game, but it requires sufficient planning (or luck) and it\\'s locked on a timer. There\\'s nothing to hold you until the ending and when it happens it\\'s incredibly underwhelming. \\n\\nEdit: After finishing the game with all my survivors still alive, I think I know why I got bored. Too much water. It\\'s such a simple thing, but it\\'s true. With 2 rain water collectors, you can collect 16 water per day for the price of 12 scrap. That water is then used to make alcohol, grow food, or grow meds and tobacco, all of which are trading staples. You can collect 16 gallons of rain water in 12 hours when its not even raining outside. You don\\'t even need to boil or otherwise sanatize your water. I never took water from scav locations because I had near unlimited amounts of it. By the end of the game, I was trading 25 gallons of water for 30+ pieces of scrap, to make more water, to make more alcohol. I didn\\'t need anything because if I ever ran low on food (I didn\\'t) I could just trade more water for food. Water is, in my opinion, the single most overpowered resource in the entire game. \\n\\nWhat\\'s underpowered, undervalued (to new players), and underavailible is electronic components. You don\\'t know how much you need until you already upgrade your workbenches, which is punishing to new players. There seems to be a finite number of this resource, but they\\'re not especially important unless your entire strategy is to make your own cigs, food, and medicene.\\n\\nFinal thought: The inventory system also doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to me, even for a video game. 15 cigs take up the same backpack space as 2 wooden planks or 4 piles of scrap? 15 cigs take up the same space as 20 bullets? Do you, player, really believe that? The limiting of these small objects doesn\\'t make me weigh the pros and cons of cigs vs wood, it just tells me \"buy it from the merchant instead.\" As a result, you can ignore luxuries entirely until your house has become the local brewery.  It\\'s even worse since there are three different types of cigs and different types don\\'t stack in the same inventory slot. So if you have 1 tobacco cig, 1 quality roll-up, and 1 roll-up you\\'re using the same inventory space as 6 wood planks OR 12 pieces of scrap. All of this points to the conclusion that inventory should have been based on weight instead of slot, because otherwise players have no need to weigh the pros and cons, there is always a definite right answer. Not all characters want luxuries and there\\'s no penalty for not getting people thier coffee or cigs so I rewarded my survivors with cigs and coffee because, again, I had nothing else to do. I was bored.',\n",

       "  'review': 'UPDATE: Having played through the DLC, I can\\'t recommend this game for the following reasons.\\n\\n- Only one of the three promised stories DLCs came out\\n- The stories DLC is very short if you are good at the game\\n- The stories DLC writing isn\\'t very good and is very predictable\\n- The pencil effect and the flashing lights triggered a twitch in my eye, and I wasn\\'t able to turn off the pencil effect entirely, nor could I turn off the flashing lights. I get that it\\'s part of the visual aesthetic, but, if annoying flashing stuff bothers you, this is really not the game for you.\\n- One achievement seems broken. Namely, if you escape the city via a boat, with a kid in your group, you do not unlock the achievement for survivng the war with a kid, the way you would if you just stayed in your house until the end of the war. Maybe this is a technical issue. I\\'m not taking points off for this, but, it\\'s very annoying.I ran through the game again, on a short 20 day run with a ton of mods, to basically rush to the end, to finally unlock that achievement...even though in my opinion, it should\\'ve been unlocked when I escaped via the boat.\\n\\nIf the rest of the promised DLC came out, if the DLC was better, and if the visual effects could have those visual screws removed, I\\'d give this a positive review.\\n\\nOLD REVIEW:\\n\\nEver wish \"The Sims\" could be really sad? This is the game for you. This is a game I like so much that I bought it on Android too. Don\\'t do that, you\\'ll stay up all night playing it.\\n\\nThis War Of Mine puts you in charge of a group of survivors in a city. You control every character as you manage things like scavenging, fighting, bartering, crafting, and doing things around your shelter. Your choices matter, and you get epilogues at the end of each game, regarding all your characters, as well as recap of major events that happened.\\n\\nThis is not a game that forces you to be good. This game doesn\\'t force you to be anything, but you\\'ll find yourself compelled to donate bandages to a hospital, or to give medicine to kids...or, as your survivors starve, to murder an innocent elderly couple and steal their food to save your own. You can play a pure good or pure evil run, but you\\'ll find it increasingly hard to stick to either path, and probably end up somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThis is not a game where good is arbitrarily rewarded more than evil. Evil is by far the most \"comfortable\" run for your survivors, because other than moral penalties and some risks of death, stealing is a lot more lucrative than scavenging. A lot of games make good the more rewarding choice in-game, with rewards that are literally better, so it\\'s no question as to what side a player chooses. Given that evil is the side with better rewards in This War Of Mine, resisting the temptation to take the easy way and rob to get what you want is hard than it would be in another game.\\n\\n\\nThe game includes:\\n\\n- Stealth\\n\\n- Fighting\\n\\n- Trading\\n\\n- Crafting\\n\\n- Loot management\\n\\n- Survival game stuff\\n\\n- Sim game stuff\\n\\n- Time management\\n\\nIt\\'s a lot like Oregon Trail...if Oregon Trail didn\\'t have a wagon but instead, a house in a city devastated by war that stood in the city...as the city fell apart around the house.\\n\\nYou can customize your game or do a preset campaign. There\\'s an active Steam Workshop and it\\'s easy to use and well integrated into the game. If you find the game too hard, there are lots of mods that make the game very, very easy.\\n\\nThis game is the epitome of \"just one more level\". In this case, it\\'s \"just one more day/night\"...both in game nights and IRL nights...\\n\\n\\nI do not have the child DLC so I can\\'t review that.',\n",

It's dark, has a great aesthetic, and the concept of playing a survival simulator in a war torn apocalyptic setting is immensely appealing to me. However as a resource gathering, emotion managing system I feel like it's just not a ton of fun. Why can only one of my characters leave home base at a time? Wouldn't going in pairs be safer?

Here are my issues.  Depressing, odds highly stacked against you, mod-able items but not characters.  There characters have stats you cant seem to be able to come close to with yours BTW.  After dying several times to the learning curve and game mechanics I am done.  Also no SAVE, where I totaly get why they decided this, I would have given us a option, any option maybe at end of every week at least.  Can't tell you how many times I either lost the main scavenger (dead) or had them leave the group.  There are so many things that could have been done in the mod community if we could have made a few easy tweaks.  Instead it is literally like banging your head against the wall trying to survive and feeling guilty about it at the same time.\",\n",

This game does not appeal to me at all. \\n\\nThis game is worthy of requesting a refund.\",\n",

Perhaps I expected too much since it\\'s been so long, but I\\'m pretty intensely disappointed with the game. \\nI suppose I read into the survival bit and glossed over the \"regular civilians\" part of it. I understand that being normal people places quite a lot of limitations on what you can do but... god damn, that\\'s not fun. At all. Having to take care of some useless drain of resources that\\'s had his mind broken is just... not fun. \\nThe art and music really reminds me of mobile games. UI is... well... functional. \\nI\\'ll give it another go in a while and see if I change my mind.',\n",

       "  'review': 'OK I get it.  War/lawlessness is hell.  Good meta-point, in all of our comfort it\\'s too easy to forget.  (Can\\'t happen here?? Go look at pics of the US Great Depression 100 years ago vs what\\'s poverty in the US now --  \"My Apple isn\\'t nearly fast enough\" vs \"I don\\'\\'t even have an Apple to eat.\"  Or read up about the US Civil War, which wasn\\'t civil on either side.)\\n\\nSo this game has turned into a psychopath.  You kill all of the NPCs when possible, but occasinally do something nice just for the bonus/luts.  Fine, but then why do I commit suicide?  I\\'m only depressed because I *DIDN\\'T* kill people.\\n\\nAlso \"you die like a dog for no reason\".  That\\'s ALSO fine, but if I\\'m fighting I want to at least swing even if I completely miss or just land a wimpy blow, I just don\\'t want to STAND there and bleed on them to drown them. If I\\'d wanted to die I\\'d just have committed suicide earlier and not have someone do it to/for me.  Duh.\\n\\nIt\\'s supposed to be a moral story and as such get under my skin.  I actually already help my neighbors and surrounding areas.  I DON\\'T help super-far-away people much because they\\'re ... well, far away.  Someone nearer to them can help more than I can.\\n\\nSo the moral of this story is: War is Hell, help those who are helping war torn areas, THANK your supporting government structures that you\\'re not in one right now, and play NetHack instead.  it\\'s just as aggravating but lots funer.  \"I\\'d rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints; the sinners are much more fun.\"',\n",

       "  'review': \"I'd prefer a middle of the road review for the game, but there's no such option. Let me say that I enjoyed it for a while, but will probably never play it again. It's unforgiving and you can be wiped out through no fault of your own. It's also massively repetitive. At some point after restarting five or six times because the RNG gave you bad locations, you'll find a gameplay loop that works for you. Then you keep doing it thirty times every day that passes. Then you realize you're doing nothing to advance the story, not getting better, and not having fun any more since it's just grinding mobs in an MMO, but only the loot part.\\nThat could all be forgiven, but the worst part of it all is that it has zero respect for your time. You can't speed the game up or pause. So, in order to get the full benefit from sleeping or whatever action you're doing in-game, you have sit and wait through every day, just sitting and doing nothing. You can end the day early, but you get no benefit from any actions that were going on before you hit the button. For hours on end, you do nothing. Then you realize that this isn't fun or entertaining, uninstall the game, and leave this review on Steam.\",\n",

I'd like to give it a better review but I don't even know what in the hell is going on with this game i've bought.

       "  'review': \"I don't get how this game has received so many positive votes and has somehow inspired the sympathy of VIDEO GAMERS for people who have been through war.  It's like somehow this game has been marketed as a gritty portrait of life as a civilian surviving in the war and has blinded people to the fact that it's actually a shit game.  Positive reviews seem to be filled with anecdotes about what was happening to their characters on day x like it's some kind of riveting story when in actuality it's a randomly generated event that adds nothing to the shitty gameplay itself.  \\n\\nFrom the clunky movement controls, to the absurd combat system, to the random events which seem to drive the story and your situation regardless of what you've been doing...the repetitive gameplay...etc on and on.  It does grab you in the beginning, but by the 5th or 6th time you're restarting and ransacking the house and reading the fucking word bubble 'Oh my goodness the shovel certainly seems to help here!' you've had about enough.\\n\\nWhere is the character depth people keep talking about?  I know there probably is a 'proper' way to play this game but it seems to be one of those 'do the exact same thing x person did on wiki' making a successful playthroughs almost identical to each other.  Give me some fucking freedom.  I'm not playing this game to check my morals and ethics.  Have a decent combat system and let me efficiently beat the sick old man and his son to death with my shovel and rob.  Let me mow down other scavengers and soldiers with the AK47 and do not obstruct me the piss poor ranged combat design.  \\n\\nAlas, if you were able to these things in the game, it would totally break it.  That's the reason all the combat mechanics are so terrible and crippling - to force you to follow through on the same repetitive task of running in and out of scavenging areas every night avoiding people.  \\n\\nIDK, wasn't for me.

Starve. Freeze. Complain. Make and eat crappy food. Get robbed in the night. Get sick. Die. Repeatedly. \\n\\nThe trailer for this game makes the scavenging portion look very deep. It is not. I snuck into my second scavenging location and was beaten to death by three npc\\'s in a matter of 10 seconds. The \"fighting\" is nonexistant. Click on the rapidly moving fist icon to prevent the npcs from slamming their fists into your frail, starving, sickly body. Oops, you died.\\n\\nInteresting idea. Nice art direction. At $5, I can\\'t complain much but I hate that \"Resident Evil 1\" feel this game has. \\n\\nAll the depth of the artistic direction and the scope of the overworld/exploration concept are good enough. But, that doesn\\'t amount to jack shit when the game devolves into a twitchy, broken mini-game during scavenging. \\n\\nWant to try this out in real life? Stop paying your electric bill. Quit your job. Give all your worldly possessions away. Now go sit in the darkest corner of your now desolate apartment/house. Start missing everything. Wait until you begin starving. Get really desperate. Now go and steal from people in the night. Oops, you\\'re malnourished and you suck at stealing. Go back to your shithole and sit in the corner until your insides rot and you begin fantasizing about \"the good things\" you miss. Maybe it would be more fun to try this under the influence of hard drugs like crystal meth. See where I\\'m going with this? Why play this game? \\n\\nWaste of $5 and an otherwise decent evening. Depression simulator. Fuck that.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Atmosphere and style of the game is great, however the game is generally awful when it comes to the actual gameplay.\\n\\nIf you just stealth past all of the enemies while looting, the game plays fine, but when they discover you or you get into combat it just becomes a clusterfuck of annoyances. If you\\'re caught looting and they initiate combat (raise fists) your character will instantly rush them with their weapon causing you to wrestle them out of the situation.\\n\\nOnce i got caught by a homelessman looting his box of goodies and as you know homeless people swarm like bees when provoked so suddenly 5 other homeless people burst into the room. Annoyingly when they raised their fists my guy decided to give up escaping a bunch of invalids and instead run back into the death brawl with a crowbar and start splitting skulls.\\nAt this point its pretty impossible to tell what the fuck is happening when you have half a dozen gray progerians attacking each other with the same exact animations (animations which end when interupted but still give damage) so my guy got out on fuck all health after killing the entire shantytown, forcing him to be bed ridden for half a week and get my entire group into a state of depression.\\nThat\\'s right, whenever you kill someone while looting (even in self defence) some characters will instantly neglect their own survival because of some mysterious sixth sense they have for comrade killings. (Even if their friend informs them, why would they? Some characters are complete psychopaths who dont care about killing others)\\n\\nIt gets so much worse when you encounter people with guns.\\n\\nThe game neglects to tell you that each character has different combat traits, some having the power to backstab while others dont, which leads to some real shitty situations where you attempt to backstab someone, causing them to turn around pitting you in a button mashing grapple as you both trade slaps until his buddy runs in and shoots through him to kill you.\\n\\nEven when you get the drop on someone it never matters, even with full armour you still have less health than most of the enemies in this game, even thugs. So when you shoot a guy half a dozen times with the assault rifle, there is literally nothing stopping them from pulling out their own gun and shooting you, causing you to lose half of your health, getting stunned for half a minute, then watching your character slowly crawl to cover like they lost their spine in the firefight.\\n\\nEven cover in this game is useless since your character seems to slowly walk to it, go into it, then exit it to hide behind something invisible, so when the enemies sprint into the room they run past the cover and point blank execute you.\\n\\nFor a game putting heavy emphasis on atmosphere, it kinda breaks when animations go from \"eh they tried\" to \"why are they squid people?\". Its ridiculous when characters are fighting for their lives and they enact the exact same animation four times in a row for stabbing someone infront of them and then freeze into position every time the animation ends so the enemy gets the chance to recover and then hit you with their own meele.\\nYou can even wipe out the entire map if you find a crack in the scenery to hide in, lure enemies with footsteps and then kill them as they walk past, then their friends will run over to the pile of their friends and get hooked by an arm 3 feet infront of them and then stabbed in the dick half a dozen times.\\n\\ntl;dr\\nGame puts massive effort into its realistic atmosphere, however the combat feels like a game of Worms.',\n",

When your people are injured, starving and have no hope left, you yourself get dragged into the game and you turn. You become someone you never thought you\\'d be, you\\'d kill for these people that don\\'t exist. This game captures war victims perfectly.\\n\\nWhile playing this game I had a group where we had 2 injured people, no supplies left, no food left. I went scavaging with one gun, and a few bullets and said \"I will do what it takes to keep these people alive.\"\\n\\nThis game is great.\\n\\nThe thing is; the devs\\' are gone, we haven\\'t had an update in months, this meaning that crashing and all that isn\\'t going to be fixed for while.',\n",

       "  'review': '***** Note: Falling back on \"War isn\\'t fair\" - IS - NOT- an excuse to make the game unfair *****\\n\\nI had originally written a positive review because of how much I loved the idea and presentation of showing how bad things are for civilians during war. The guilt and tragedy they go through when you\\'re forced to do things that you wish you didn\\'t have to. The idea and story is all well done.\\n\\nHOWEVER, the balance and design of this game is awful. For one, there is absolutely zero way to increase your inventory which is completely absurd. This is made unbearably insulting when there\\'s a massive inventory that has 3 entire rows greyed out, never to be used. WHY? WHAT IS THE POINT OF THAT? Why should it take modding to fix such a blatently obvious detail? Everyone gets the point, it\\'s hard to survive. We get it. Here\\'s the thing, you can still convey that without the completely unneeded difficulty curve of not being able to carry anything. Playing \\'Organ Trail\\' lets you trade forever and gain an insane amount of supplies and guess what, it\\'s still hard to survive. \\n\\nWhat\\'s absolutely unforgivable however, is the combat system in this game. Again, everyone gets it. Everyone understands your point. War sucks and combat isn\\'t certain. That said, it is completely unforgivable design to have my character stun locked and killed by a persons fists because THEY NEVER BOTHER TO SWING THE AXE I GAVE HIM. It\\'s so insanely infuriating when you lose your scavenger because the game just DECIDES you don\\'t get to swing... ever. \\n\\nSo yeah, the game has a great story, music, art, and premise but backs this up with appaling design practices that lead to completely unfair scenarios that require mods to even bridge the difficulty to reasonably playable.',\n",

There is absolutely nothing you can do about this. You can do amazingly well during every scavenging phase but you will lose because of perpetual raids that happen in the background.\\n[*] The gap between the amount of building materials you can scavenge at once and the amount of those materials needed to actually build something useful is HUMONGOUS.

       "  'review': \"I bought this game hoping for something different and interesting more than something I expected to get a lot of joy out of.  The theme is a bit dark to expect joy from after all.  My expectations were fairly low going in.  They needed to be a lot lower.\\n\\nTechnically, the game works fine.  I didn't encounter any bugs that I noticed, and it looks good.  You can almost forget its 2D at times thanks to the art.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that's where my appreciation has to end.  The developers have made so many choices, clearly deliberate choices, that simply ruin any enjoyment I might otherwise get from the game.  The first one I noticed was that I can only ever send one guy out scavenging.  I couldn't understand that decision for the life of me, but I could deal with it.\\n\\nThe bigger problem (for me) hit me soon after.  Crafting.  Crafting in this game is nonsensical.  The same materials make crowbars and water filters.  The sorts and amounts of materials you need for doing most anything are... seemingly random.  They don't change or anything, they just don't make sense.  \\n\\nThe crafting materials themselves don't make much sense either.  They clearly wanted to make things simple, and streamlined, and as some one who has actually made most of the things you can “make” in this game... just no.  Much of it is actually harder to “make” in game than it is to actually make (looking at you water filters) while other things (crowbar, for example) are far to easy to make... and break so quickly that they're clearly crude approximations of their namesakes, but work far too well for such.  I suppose that's par for the survival game course, but I still find it jarring.\\n\\nCrafting baffles me again with it's prerequisites.  You need to upgrade your workbench before you can... board up the gaping holes in the wall.  Uh.... no.  A rock (a rock tied to a stick is much less injury prone), and some nails you fished out of the ashes after burning some reclaimed wood will work.  It isn't fun, but it does function, so long as the nails aren't too rusted away.  (Yeah, I've done this too.  Hammer's are awesome.)\\n\\nSo, the crafting was just too gamey for me.  If that won't bother you, then it won't bother you.\\n\\nAnother gamey thing is how fast plants grow.  Even radishes don't grow that fast.  Maybe bean sprouts?  If so, where did the beans come from, and why didn't you just eat them?\\n\\nThen there's the fact that you can just start a fire, whenever... somehow.  The only way that makes sense is if you have Bruno, the compulsive smoker.  I figure he had a lighter (major currency item in under siege Sarajevo btw).  Otherwise, well, I find it hard to believe that the characters in game were all that good with a bow drill, or a sun lens, or even know what char cloth is.\\n\\nMy biggest issue with the game was the characters.  The game asks you “how far will you go to protect the people you care about?”  I quickly realized that I didn't care about any of these characters, at all.  Maybe there was some hidden info to make you more invested in them that I missed.  If there is, well, that sort of thing probably shouldn't be hidden.\\n\\nWith some exceptions, the characters in this game are... well, they're sort of people I moved to the middle of the woods to get away from.  They don't know anything useful. They get upset about things that make no sense, and they care more about their addictions now than having food tomorrow.  I've known six year old children that would be more useful in a survival situation than some of these characters.\\n\\nI do find these characters believable.  I also find myself uninterested in their plight.  In a game that asks me to care, and to do things because I care... well.. it's a bridge too far, on top of the wonky crafting, miracle gardens, and solitary hero salvage runs.\\n\\nIn the end, I just don't care, and that just kills the game, for me at any rate.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I used to recommend this game, but the recent dlc has made this game nearly unplayable.\\n\\n\"But Norinia! You haven\\'t even bought The Last Broadcast! You must just be making stuff up!\"\\n\\nExcept that\\'s the biggest issue. I haven\\'t bought The Last Broadcast, and it\\'s forced on me anyways.\\n\\nI prefer to play create your own story mode usually, however, each time I start the game up, it forces me to use The Last Broadcast\\'s shelter. This would not be an issue if the shelter was just like any of the others, it looks amazing. However, like stated above, I do not own The Last Broadcast. The Last Broadcast requires special objects and characters to operate the shelter. I don\\'t have those, because like stated AGAIN, I Do Not Own The DLC!\\n\\n\"You must have been messing with mods! So it\\'s your own fault!\" Ah Ah Ah! Here\\'s the second issue.\\n\\nTHE MOD WORKSHOP IS DOWN\\n\\nThat\\'s right. Mods do not work. The game will not read mods anymore, due to the update for the previous mentioned DLC!\\n\\nWhat does that mean? That means the update screwed the entire game. \\n\\nI have yet to check if the usual random story mode works as it should, But I loved setting up my own scenerio, and I loved having custom characters to create my own story with. With this, I can\\'t play them anymore. \\n\\nOh yeah, and with The Last Broadcast\\'s shelter, there is no where to set up children toys, and there is no random areas to play. Meaning the kids will eventually get incredibly bored, rendering The Little Ones DLC (Which I do have.) useless. You can still add kids to your custom game and have your custom characters in the create a story, but half of the shelter is cut off due to the fact you can\\'t access it, and your kids will have nothing to do but chat with the adults once a day. \\n\\nOh and there\\'s a bunch of stations already set up in the building (herbal workshop, garden on the other side of the blockcade, things like that. there\\'s even a couch) so your already limited shelter is limited further. It\\'s great to have those, but with limited things, having the garden on your side probably would have been more useful than the herbal workshop that you generally just use to make cigarettes.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping maybe this is all down because the devs are creating a much more in depth character creation (currently, you can only choose between a few certain classes for your character to be. You can\\'t write their backstory or connect them to characters you\\'ve already made or even give them special abilities and addictions, making your characters weaker in terms of ability and story telling, unlike the already scripted characters that are in game that will always have a story to each other on how they met.) which in turn will make a much more in depth mod workshop, but from what I\\'m seeing online, The Last Broadcast is being hailed as amazing, and no one has mentioned any bugs. I\\'m sure the DLC is amazing, but I bought the DLC I wanted, and my game should work without being forced to buy all the DLC. \\n\\nThank you for reading all the way down here, I recommend you find another story game to play, as this one is broken and likely will never be fixed.',\n",

       "  'review': 'TL:DR - The game is $4 so don\\'t expect much. Not a good game though, even by indie standards. So buy it if you want it\\'s not a terrible waste. The characters are pussies and annoying, none of them show Leadership/Strength/Persevernce/Intelligence. I get they\\'re going through an unimaginably shitty time, one that most people can\\'t understand. But goddamn guys these people have no positive traits. \"Good Cook\" Eat shit.\\n\\n\\nGarbage game  4/10. I have no idea why it\\'s getting overwhelmingly positive reviews. I guess for $4 you can\\'t criticize too much.\\nAnyway.\\n1. No tutorial (wtf?) on anything. \\n2. Combat is FUCKING ass. Don\\'t expect to win any fight because these hippie shit bags force the peace agenda down your throat. So annoying. The combat is point and click by the way.\\n3. Game is just one big message of \"War is bad! Have good morals!\" which is something I normally agree with. But this game would actually be worth money if they would have at least acknowledged the \"bandit\" argument. Instead of all the bandits being 80 I.Q. rapists. Like seriously? are you that close minded?\\n4. No replay value. After you beat it once you got the full package. You can play again with slightly different places and people but in the end it changes nothing. I beat it in 2-ish hours.\\n5. No strategic value and relies heavily on luck (unless you google everything).\\n6. One-dimensional characters. No one actually brings up anything intelligent. Nor does the game put you in thought provoking or controversial situations. The best it had was a soldier raping a woman and you can\\'t stop him because he has an AK-47 and you have a knife. As mentioned above combat is ass so there is no possible way you can beat him through \"skill\". You never get attached to the characters so when they die you\\'re more of \"Goddamnit I wasted so much supply on keeping this pig alive\" instead of \"Anton died? Oh god... \". \\n7. The text that tells you what effects your people have (important information) can\\'t be adjusted. So if you can\\'t read it, tough shit bud.\\n8. Has DLC. Lol.\\n9. Anyone who tells you the game is realistic is smoking some good shit. You don\\'t die from guns very fast/You never die to random mortor fire/Houses and Buildings never get destroyed throughout the 40 day period (or however long you set it). You can never switch houses. You can\\'t carry multiple backpacks or send multiple people out to scavenge. Fuckers get very hungry in one day and die from hunger in 3-4. Someone has never went without food for more than a day. Also no sneak attacks. You can\\'t ride up on a bandit and slice his neck.\\n10. The things it does simulate are just annoying. People can never be cured of illness, if they have a gun and you don\\'t you\\'re boned. The characters get sad over EVERYTHING. \"I couldn\\'t give that kid medicine, I\\'m a monster!\" BITCH we didn\\'t have medicine, let your balls drop and get over it. They don\\'t ever cheer up either. \\n11. YOU CAN\\'T SEND MORE THAN ONE PERSON TO SCAVENGE.\\n12. ^\\n13. Guitars are actually the most useless thing on the planet. I spent SO MUCH supply on building a guitar and chairs around it. Just so I could make them sit around the listen to the chick play, with them cheering up.  IT DID NOTHING.\\n14. Easy way to win. Crank out as many small animal traps as you can, because rats are infinite. They make up the space between particles they\\'re so fucking numerous. (It\\'s a joke don\\'t bust my balls chemists)',\n",

You dont really have much of a chance. \\nControlling your character is a pain as well. it has about a good 2 second delay when you stop your character. for example when you run forward then stop your character will keep running for a few more steps. You cant pin point spots. \\nOverall the game had a neat idea to it but its setup to make you fail everytime with very little chance. It\\'s not that enjoyable. Sure everyone will post \"Well you didnt read the guilds\" No need to honestly.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I initially enjoyed this game, and while I still think it's nicely done in some ways, I just had to add a negative review since it hasn't had that many. \\n\\nAfter finishing it 1 1/2 times I'm over it. It's repetitive and uninteresting. I feel no emotional connection to any of my characters, which really means I don't ever get the feeling of having to make 'tough decisions' as others have claimed. The bleakness of the games aesthetics do more to depress me about wasting my own life playing a resource management sim, rather than make me empathise with these characters. \\n\\nYes it's about how people would normally endure war, much different to most violent games one would otherwise play, but that doesn't necessarily make it fun or even interesting. It does, however, end in an emperor's new clothes style blanket positive reviews, as peoples' minds are blown that it realistically represents how experiencing a war must be, and they feel they must express this. This may be to show off their burgeoning sympathy/empathy, in understanding the suffering of others. That's great and all, the only problem is in this game, you're basically just a bean counter, which isn't very fun.\",\n",

Since it's a rogue-like (try again and again and again) it completely turned me off from actually finishing the game. \\n\\nThere's no tutorial, you're thrown into the thick of things - which adds to the experience of survival - but when it takes 1 hour to do anything meaningful, it makes learning the game a very, very slow affair. I've just decided to give up on it after a few hours of gameplay because one of my characters just died froma very stupid mistake on my part (I clicked on the wrong room, he was spotted and killed) and the game becomes unmanageable once that happens.\\n\\nGreat for the first 4 hours.

       "  'review': \"Meh, sure, do get it on sale. But I am so very glad I haven't paid the full price.\\n\\nThe base management is awfully silly, with only one real production chain.\\n\\nThe difficulty... What difficulty? I've reached the ceasfire on the first try with no idea what I was doing (no lets plays, spoilers, nothing). Played four different stories and I haven't lost... ever.\\n\\nThere's much annoyance in the game (e.g. in the winter you have to keep your heater full of wood, so you can't end the day early even if you have nothing else to do - the temperature will drop and people will get sick). The stories that intend to be more difficult (only one survivor, or two really bad ones) achieve this by being even more annoying. \\n\\nYou can't go for any kind of sustainability, cause everything is tied to components (or otherwise arbitrarily limited, like you can only have two traps) - which take a lot of carrying space when scavenging and are otherwise very limited when trading. I always have enough goods to buy more components, I always want more components, there's never enough components. It's not just for building, it's for everything. To grow food you need water. To prepare food you need water. How do you get water? With a filter made with components. And it serves no real purpose, since there's only one production chain (so you can't adapt by switching what you were doing) and there's nothing else to do (so you just sit on your ass and wait for more components). On the other hand, even with unlimited components, just feeding that one silly chain would be tedious and boring.\\n\\nSpeaking of arbitrary restrictions, you can't have more than one person scavenging. Apparently the city is not big enough (although I've had a bug once, where the game claimed two people brought supplies from scavenging).\\n\\nBasically it's a glorified tamagotchi in a war setting. Built like a free to wait game, except your credit card won't alleviate the waiting. I was more attached to the tamagotchi than the characters here. First playthrough is like 6-8 hours and the second part of that already gets annoying and repetitive. The immersion is easily killed by bugs, that are quite common (although not gamebreaking - but you might lose one of your survivors to a bug, not get a very important loot item due to a but etc. It's not a huge problem considering the overall difficulty).\\n\\nApparently war is buggy, easy to survive and rather boring.\",\n",

You literally spend minutes each day passively watching you characters do the same things: cooking, building, cheering each other up. There is nothing positive to say about daytime. You just struggle to keep everyone alive, repair stuff that got broken during the night and various routine. Note that in daytime you can't even go out of the house and the occasional traders or npc interactions are completely useless because your team will be to broke/tired to do anything.\\n\\nNight time is pain: you finally get to play the game, but it's so badly designed and implemented it will just result in failure. First of all, the location descriptions is completely flawed, and in most places you'll only find useless gears or wood, even if it says food and meds. Second, you are supposed to kill people (I guess?) But the combat system is so badly implemented you basically have no control on the outcome of the fight. Not only that, but if you actually end up killing someone your dude will get depressed and just lie in bed. Finally, my favourite part, while you have to deal with all this shit, the npc's can just shoot you on sight and instakill you no question asked, even if you went bare handed. I also find it ridiculous that the game gives you zero explanation of the basic mechanics so that you can fuck up a multi-hour long run just because you didn't know a particular interactio  (remember that you cant save...), it just feels like an artificial way to inflate playtime.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I really wanted to like this game but for the second time after playing for an extended period of time one of my main characters died from the extremely bad combat system. The first time it happened I tried attacking a stronger enemy, but once you have thrown the first punch the next attack will be randomly generated based on your characters stats at that time. The combat system is extremely unintuitive and I would strongly recommend watching a tutorial before starting your first game.\\n\\nThe second time, having learnt my lesson, or so I thought, I attacked an enemy sneaking up on him from behind with a knife. In all other games through the history of gaming this results in an instant kill, but not in this game. I severely injured the enemy who then turns around to fight me. No biggie I thought to myself, I'll kill him with my next swing, WRONG. At this point the awful combat system kicks in and even though I keep pressing the button to attack, my character just stands around and waits for the enemy to take three free swings at him that utlimately kills him.\\n\\nThis would not be as bad, if it wasn't for the fact that I had invested a lot of time in the game already, and that the combat mechanics and rules of combat were never explained to me as a player in a good way. Especially as the combat mechanics do not resemble combat mechanics established by hundreds of similar games.\\n\\nSome might say that you are supposed to fail in this game, or that your characters are not experienced soldiers and thus should suck at combat. But in my mind there's no excuse for making the player fail at what they are doing even though they might be doing everything right.\\n\\nOther than that the game gets boring and repetitive rather quickly, it's an interesting concept that does not really deliver any entertaining gameplay.\\n\\nIf the random elements were removed from combat I might be able to recommend this game, but in its current state I would not.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Well, I read so many reviews and was stunned by the positivity and at the same time reading so much about bugs. Which is the main reason why I do not recommend this game. \\n\\nThe first simple thing is, if you can't even alt + tab a game without crashing it, then I cannot recommend it. I don't know a single gamer who doesn't have to do that once in a while. The second thing (also connected to the bugs) is the saving system. If the game crashes or you leave after a day (day and night are played one after another), you cannot continue at night, no, you have to start during day again.\\n\\nI could go on as there are MANY things like that that got me to this opinion. Don't get me wrong: the idea of this game is nice. The graphics are decent. The gameplay and the UI are ok - and yes, I won't give it more than an ok for that. But if bugs ruin your game experience so much as they did for me (within the 1st two days of playing), then I have to say that it is poorly programmed and needs a lot of bug patches. A lot... browse the forums if you do not believe me.\\n\\nAs soon as they got rid of the bugs, I can recommend this game, but not before that. Clearly not.\",\n",

Nothing special to me though. Difficult at times to tell what an object was even in daylight\\n\\nSound 4/5 not bad . The soundtrack has good background music but very repetitive. The sound fx were pretty good \\n\\nControls 2/5 I had a hard time getting up and down stairs and selecting items when multiple choices were made available. It was clunky and did not feel polished. It is playable once you get used to it. I was not fan though\\n\\nGameplay 4/5 You have to survive, and it is not easy at all. It very hard. I am starving, getting raided, can't find supplies and dying. This game does nothing to help you. It is very punishing. I am never a fan of games that just punish you  but that is kind of the point of this game. It really does add a realism effect. Life is punishing. You might not actually find food or medicine. You will probably die during a war. You will starve, Your wounds will kill you. \\n\\nI will keep trying to play this from time to time. Honestly I would not suggest this game. A lot of people love it and I understand why. This game was not for me. I might change my review if during one of the sessions playing this changes my mind. It looks ok. The controls are not great. The crafting system is just OK. It does sort of feel prentious. \\n\\nI can say overall is a 3/5. It's good. Not great. \\n\\nI think if it was polished a bit more and maybe there was 2 modes - weakling mode for people like me and hardcore mode for you real survivors I could see this working.\",\n",

The gameplay is point and click which is fine, but none of the game is explained to the player. As the game progresses, more information is unlocked about each of the survivors, but that's most of what we learn about the character. Doing things in the settlement takes time, but there is no way to fast forward time progression beyond jumping to night. This is a massive oversight. The game boils down to a resource management simulator that lacks depth. Finally, every time a device connected via USB was disconnected, the game would instantly crash and I'd need to repeat that same in game day.

I found myself bored of the game after I just ended up doing the same thing over and over and over again. So you if you get bored from grinding, or things of that sort, fairly easily stay away from this game. Also Some of the characters are clearly better than others so it gets kinda frustrating when you're a hour into a playthrough and you realize that this game could be 10 times easier. I would only recommend this game if it's on sale and even then play the first hour. If you don't like it then just return because the rest of the game is just going to be more of the same \\n\\nThose are my thoughts, my dude.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is not bad game it is just not my kind of game. I bought this in the sale when it was cheap but I’m really not sure why, even a skim read of the store page makes it clear that is not the kind of game I would enjoy.\\n\\nThe game aims to capture the harsh realities of civilians trapped in a war zone trying to survive. Having never any experience of war I have no idea how accurate it is but dear god this is grim. I started off with the good intentions of scavenging resources and staying out of trouble but this game will not let you get away with that. Before long you will be starving and you will be forced to die or steal from other innocent people. But when you start doing that everyone’s moral drops and everything spirals out of control. By the time my last character killed themself I was equally desperate for an end to the misery. Most games have a fairly simple moral choice system, press A to kill all the children, press B to save all the children, that kind of thing, but not here each moral choices come down to die or screw someone else over. The game also doesn’t bribe you to help others in the same way most games do. In your standard RPG if you help someone out then you will likely get a flaming spam hammer of ass kicking or similar as a reward. Here you might get a trinket or such which you can trade for a tin of beans to stave off death for another day but usually if you give a kid some medication you will just get a sense of well being that you helped someone (with a slight sense of trepidation that they might come back and rob you later).\\n\\nThe difficulty of this game prevented me from enjoying it but I’m not really sure I’m supposed to enjoy the game. There are a number of mods in the workshop to reduce the difficulty but most of these have been broken by game updates so I started tinkering around with the modding tools and only succeeded in completely removing any challenge or satisfaction to the game.\\n\\nI played through the game 3 times and it does get somewhat repetitive cycling between scavenging and crafting. The locations and characters in them are the same in each playthrough.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a fun game this is not for you, if you are looking for a dark, difficult, stylish looking game that will draw you in with the struggles of the characters then this is it.',\n",

But the game is hopelessly crippled by its (lack of) pace. Characters move slowly, crafting takes time, you find yourself waiting endlessly. All this may add up to build atmosphere in the first few playthroughs, but it quickly gets old. It could be fixed with a speed-up button, no big deal. I've googled this, and people have been asking for this for as long as the game has been around. Unless you have too much time to waste - in which case playing games is the least of your concerns - steer clear of this one.

I couldn't get past 30 minutes of walking around collecting supplies and watching orange progress circles (which indicate various tasks being completed).  It's a shame because this game has a really great feel and the music is superb.  If you enjoy loot gathering games, this one is for you; if not, steer clear.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Overwhelmingly positive. Wow. \\n\\nFirst of all, this game is not bad. It is kinda specially because the game simulate something real, and is published at a good time. In this game you scavenge, make decision, and everything will have a consequence. You actually mmight feel guilty about your way of survival if you robbed unarmed people, and I guess this is the point the game wants to deliver to the players.\\n\\nHowever no matter you want to play the game in a peaceful way or the other, you will need to figure out what barrier in different locations and what kind of enemies are guarding there, so you could survive. Otherwise, you won't be able to make it after a few runs.\\n\\nBecause this game is SUPER NOT BALANCED.\\n\\nYou get so little from scarvange, and you characters are so fragile they easily get sick or wounded, especially boundage and madicine are such of high price, most of the time you barely have any of them. So after a few runs I began to think it is designed to let you make some ungodly move. You also won't be able to trade enough for what are considered to be essential, food, is another good example, let alone for guitar or other entarimentment stuff. Occasionally you got lucky to earn a gun, but you run out of ammo so quick and it's even not the beginning of winter, when you got robbed more often during the night.\\n\\nDid I mention you also need to feed empty bellies, and how hard it is just to get enough food? I don't often play survival games, but I've been playing video games since I was a kid. This is not supposed to be the way of a good game design. It is a good idea to let poeple experience the hard life of refugees, but as a conmertial game, shouldn't entertain players be more important?\\n\\nIntersting so many people rate is positive. It is fun for the first few hours, and then it became borning and painful.\",\n",

Only one person can be sent out to scavenge every night, and since the inventory space is very low you have to repeatadely come to the same place for like 5 times.\\n2. No skip button - when in day phase there's no way to speed up the time, so you have to wait for 2-5 minutes aimlessly until your vegetables finish growing, or you collect the water you need, or while your characters sit in a talking animation. This happens every single day and again, makes the game boring.\\n3. Saving is only done at the beginning of each day. Meaning, if you make a mistake, guess what, you have to sit through the entire day again, and watch your characters comfort each other for 5 minutes.\\n\\nI would reccomend this on sale, but wouldn't buy this for full price.\\n\\n\",\n",

Personally, the only apsect of this game I enjoyed was the art style. you're meant to survive for perhaps 40 days and the game gives you (in my case) 2 locations with enough food to last a solid evening and light brunch, the garden I built wasn't able to grow anything edible unless you count chewing tobacco as nutritious for some reason. \\n\\nBasically this game doesn't seem finished and ulitmately not enjoyable for me what so ever, the rate of resource accrual is just appalling, you can send someone out every night and it still isn't enough to sustain yourself, but I mean maybe I just didn't pay attention in the tutorial. Oh? what? no tutorials? fair enough its not like this game is overly complex and you can get stuck trying to run down stairs for 3 minutes... \\n\\nI don't think this game was meant for pc, or maybe its not meant to be played in general, but I didn't like it what so ever and I hope to whatever god neglected to help this dev team that I can get a refund.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"After a ragequit that lasted almost a year, I decided to give it another try, and oh boy, I got some things to say.\\nFirstly, the game is very difficult and not quite entertaining, it puts you in a bad spot every time. \\nFrom my perspective, there's just 2 ways of beating this game: by pure try and error, or by reading a guide. If you choose the first one, it could take you around 20 hours and lots of headaches to finish the first story, which is pretty bad because the game has like 6 stories that get more difficult. If you choose to play the game while reading guides,it'll make you understand things easily. but eventualy, you'll find out that the game is very limited and that in order to do well in the game, it's very necessary to  follow a specific way of playing, which is not fun at all.\\nAfter all, the concept may be worthy, but be aware that this game is for a very specific type of player.\\nIf you don't want to waste your life and feel frustrated very often and at the end of the game feel dissatisfied AF and quite depressed, just skip it.\\nTrust me, there are better things to do with your time.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I paid £3.74 for this, as it was on sale. I find it difficult to recommend this game for the full £15.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe with the game is it\\'s repetitive grinding and identical play throughs. Nothing is randomly generated in this game - it\\'s just a set of about 20 different locations that you visit on all of your play throughs. The loot and enemy spawns do not vary, and you ultimately get bored quickly when you realise that the game is playing out exactly the same as it did the last time you played.\\n\\nOn top of that, an awkward control scheme of \"left click only\" results in some awkward deaths. With the exit to my right, and an army of thugs to my left, I choose the option \"run to exit\". In my case, my character decided to run upstairs, which got me lost in the building and ultimately ended up in my frustratingly awkward demise as I had to manually tell my character to run back down the stairs and past the shotgun wielding thugs.\\n\\nBut nevermind, I guess I could just load my save again, right? Nope. \\n\\nThere are no save games in this game either. If one of your characters dies, there is no turning back. After the second awkward death in as many hours, I decided to try my hand at surviving with my remaining two characters. This was near impossible - I could not balance their sleep/hunger/medicine enough to both guard my base, and also scavange for more supplies. Eventually this leads to one of the following:\\n\\na) I leave my base to scavenge: my supplies get looted.\\nb) I stay to defend, and never leave: I run out of supplies.\\n\\nThe magic number of three survivors allows you to Sleep / Guard / Scavenge all at one. Take one survivor out, and the cycle is shot to hell.\\n\\nThe awkward controls, poor pathfinding, cluttered UI of \"interact\" symbols, and the poor balancing between \"difficult and fun\" make this game a real displeasure to play. It\\'s such a shame - I had been waiting to play this for so long, only to be let down by it\\'s repeated insistance to rub dirt in my eye at every turn.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edited - to remove disclaimer as I have now checked and the complaints below are valid and not just that i have missed a mechanic or option in the game...\\n\\nOk, so, this is a tricky review to write because i\\'m not a completely sociopathic person and i do understand human suffering and that war is a terrible thing.  But that\\'s rather the point, i do know that already and i wanted a game not a never-ending stream of \"War is bad mmmm-Kay\" with - and this is the main point of this rant - very little game attached.\\n\\nDaytime - there is essentially feck all to do in this section of the game. 2 minutes of cooking and eating and maybe build a thing, and then you have to sit through the rest of the day so all of your little dudes/dudettes can have a go at sleeping. Because there\\'s no way to queue actions and no fast forward time button. And no way to check what materials something needs without one of your very very slow little people walking to the damn workbench to look. And why the heck can\\'t i upgrade the damn stove just because there\\'s a pot of food sitting on it? Just move it to the damn fridge little man...  And if you do make a lovely, well-equipped house for the little people are they happy? No, it\\'s \"a brief respite from the horrors that surround us\" because god forbid there might be a second where we aren\\'t reminded that War is Bad.\\n\\nSo we come to Nighttime - that\\'s gonna be more fun, we\\'ll be sneaking about on perilous, action-packed escapades! Oh. For starters, it won\\'t be \"we\" because for some completely non-explained reason no matter how desperate we are for resources only one of my little people is allowed out at night. The others will sit on their arses and whine about being hungry and even starve and still a second person may never leave. Presumably something to do with War being Bad. But ok. at least my one little dude who is a \"Skilled Scavenger\" will do something exciting! Hmm, well, actually it turns out i don\\'t have a sawblade so i can\\'t get in to the room with the shiny stuff (apparently my \"Skilled Scavenger\" can\\'t just use that pile of metal scrap that\\'s right there to knock a hole in the wall of the completely abandoned. shelled house) - guess i\\'ll go clear this rubble so i can get at that interesting looking cupboard. Oh Christ. I\\'m going to have to sit and watch him spend most of the night scraping some rocks. Because there\\'s no fast forward time button. I guess if there was I might not have as much time to sit and think about how War is Bad.\\n\\nAnd a final note on that, you know one of the ways that people deal with War being Bad? Humour. And there is not a drop of it to be found in this game anywhere.\\n\\nSo is there anything good about this game? Yes.  The artwork is awesome, it\\'s certainly atmospheric (if rather one-dimensionally so), and it is in a strange way somewhat compelling - otherwise i wouldn\\'t have spent so many hours on a very annoying game.  Unfortunately, none of that can make up for gameplay and interface being borderline terrible.',\n",

After a while of frustratingly trying to start a game I realized the UI was hidden and I could hear some feedback when the cursor rolled over what must be a menu. I clicked the highest button I could sense this way and finally started a game. At that point it was pure confusion and without an interface I have no idea what to do.\\n\\nI'm assuming that this game is finished beyond this point, so I'm open to that it may be some sort of uncommon problem or something.

       "  'review': 'On balance this really isn\\'t a great game.  It DOES hook you in and you find that you have devoted some hours to what is really just boring monotony and after you\\'ve invsted tons of hours you are liable to suddenly find your characters quickly all die with little you can do about it.\\n\\nThe graphics are basic, essentially you generally control 3+ cartoon like sprites and there is nothing else moving on screen, yet the game hogs CPU resources like you were playing Halo !  Just crazy.\\n\\nThe major thing I didn\\'t like about the game is that it appears to deliberately make life difficult for you.  Doesn\\'t matter what decisions you make, the game will find a way to level you out.  It\\'s like games like Oblivion where, when you finnaly get a God like sword and look forward to carving through swathes of monsters, you find the game has levelled up all the monsters so it\\'s no different.  Very unrewarding.\\n\\nSo here, if you have lots of timber and components and need cogs to make something, when you go out and scavenge you\\'ll find tons more timber and components and sweet FA cogs.\\n\\nIf your party has bandages but no meds, sure enough the characters will become sick leaving you stranded.  If you have meds but no bandages then sure enough, the house will be raided overnight and characters will be wounded and without bandages quickly deteriorate.\\n\\nThe moral aspects of the game are a horrible element imo.  Just stupid.   If the scavenger does anything remotely \"bad\" the whole party gets depressed.  I mean you\\'re surviving a war so stealing for example is highly likely to happen, but if you do it, expect the game to brutally punish you by dropping moral of the party.  Characters go from Sad, to Depressed to Broken pretty quickly and trying to recover that position once the juggernaut has started rolling is very difficult.  If you don\\'t have books or armchairs or coffee, smokes etc then it\\'s a quick decline.  The most stupid aspect is Broken status.  Your character won\\'t do anything at all.  Will just stand or sit there and is useless from that point on, may as well be dead.\\n\\nIn the final analysis it feels like you are just following the pre-programmed route for the game, you don\\'t really have choices, though it creates the illusion that you do.  You have to play the way the game wants you to or it stuffs you.\\n\\nThere are the basics of a good idea here, but as implemented it\\'s just a time waster that deliberately skews the numbers against you to prolongue the play time.  You win if the game wants you to win.\\nWhen you do finally win after all the hours and effort expended in monotnous repetitive actions, what do you get?  A black screen with 2 words in white . . .  \"You Survived\".\\n\\nToo much of the mechanics (resource management) doesn\\'t make sense.  You have the ability to build rat traps (with the appropriate resources) but once you\\'ve built 2, the GAME doesn\\'t let you build more !  No reason why the characters couldn\\'t or shouldn\\'t, they have the resources, but no, the game just says no, 2 is it, I\\'m removing the option after that point.  \\n\\nSo, as I said, the game doesn\\'t let you get ahead.  You don\\'t really have choices.  You DO have to build a stove, a heater, a water distiller, beds etc.  No choice, you build them or die.  You can\\'t inventively do anything, you can\\'t out-think the game, you can\\'t therefore experiment how you might survive in such a war.   You are merely playing numbers.  X timbers + Y components = item.  Item + something else = another item.  etc etc.   Always on the back foot, always fighting a game that won\\'t let you get ahead.  It presents options for stealing and killing people, but if you do, the game punishes you.  Ultimately just silly.\\n\\nIt is in the end a glorified time waster that doesn\\'t reward at any stage.',\n",

Make a radio! Because clearly everyone on the planet knows how to make a radio from junk. The lack of difficulty in this area makes surviving seem very casual and without consequence most of the time.\\n-Depression and sadness have no real consequence, being broken makes a person sit down like a spoilt child not getting their way and a quick talk or a drink will brighten them up right away. I actually laughed when this occured in my playthough.\\n-Illogical scavenging, it's cold and you need firewood so should you take that axe and cut down that tree in the backyard with the tree house in it? I mean that would keep the fire lit all winter right? It'll be easy to get it inside too as it's right next to the house! No, you must cross a war torn town in the middle of the freezing night to get wood out of the ass end of nowhere and attempt to carry it back in a rucksack.\\n\\n\\nAll in all there's little to nothing to enjoy about the game, it's nice to look at and that's where it ends.

Easy enough to pick up but has enough to explore. The aesthetic is beautiful but the story lacks where it could excel. A thing I found odd is how black and white issues were as you were seen as either good or bad based off a yes or no decision. Beside these decisions, more narrative could help offer grey solutions. It simply isn\\'t deep enough of a game to put a whole lot of time in.\"\\n\\n[b]Rating: 5.9/10[/b]\\n\\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePentacidist/]-Penta[/url]',\n",

       "  'review': 'I think \\'This War of Mine\\' an important game to talk about, because it approaches a topic no other games do - being a civilian in a war zone. The problem is, to me, that it\\'s not a great game.\\n\\nI love the game for it\\'s idea to give you a feeling of being stuck in a war as a civilian and how it tries to convey the hardship you would have to endure.\\nSadly it does it technically in such a bad, unnecessarily tedious way (like being able to scavenge only at night + only 1 person at a time) that it ends up scewing the whole experience.\\n\\nFurthermore the game is also very unrealistic. For example, a human can survive for about 30-40 days without food (if hydrated, and you would die around 45 - 60 days). Yet in the game, after two days of (still) eating a littlebit, they seem to begin to starve.\\nAlso water, unless there\\'s a chemical or radioactive fallout, it\\'s pretty safe to drink rainwater. You don\\'t need to construct a filter every day to use it, you can just boil it to be on the safe side. Not to mention you can just put a pot in the open to collect rainwater, why the need to build a complicated machine for it?\\n\\nFurthermore the graphics. I get it that the Developer wanted to convey a bleak feeling, but if you watch footage of the war in the Ukraine, Iraq, Nigeria, or Syria, it\\'s not all dark, grey and muddy. \\nSometimes the days look really beautiful and peaceful, like nothing as happened. That is what is so surreal about war, the cruelty and destruction thrown against the beautiful environment of a once thriving life - which is now crumbling under it\\'s horrors.\\n\\n\\nTo me it seems that the Developer didn\\'t do much research on life and survival in a war zone, and instead just did what he thought people would do in such a situation, and what it would be like. \\nHonestly, a lot feels forced and arbitrary to me. Like the Dev had to limit your possibilities to make you feel how hard war is. Which to me is a really bad choice, because it makes it feel unrealistic and like a \"game\", and not like a real experience.\\n\\nInstead make things meaningful - for example the limit of scavenging with only 1 person; Allow more than one to scavenge, but that would increase the risk of being overwhelmed in a raid. See? No artificial limitation and you immediately have a stronger impact of your gameplay choices, and a stronger experience of the hard choices to be made in a conflict.\\n\\n\\nWhat I really like about the game though is how some of the AI families react if you kill one of them. This is really well done.\\n\\n.\\n\\nSo overall I think, if the game was better designed - and more realistic, the emotional impact would have been much stronger and probably made people think about war much more.\\nNow it\\'s just an okay building / survival game with a war background. And if it hadn\\'t that, I am sure the overall rating would be much lower.\\n\\nI praise the Developer for trying, and for how it got people to talk about war (well, did it? How many of you actually did research furthermore into armed conflicts after playing the game?). Yet I just can\\'t recommend it. I wish there was a \"neutral\" option for reviews.\\n\\nSo my suggestion is to watch actual footage from armed conflicts, and donate the money directly to charities instead (like Doctors without Borders). Believe me, it will make you feel and think much more.',\n",

       "  'review': \"If you're feeling too cheery, your life is going too well for you, and you need a good dose of depression, have I got the game for you.  You can think of this game as Sad Sims in Wartime.  Only there's not much fighting.  Mostly scrounging for junk, eating, smoking, trading, moping, and starving.  That might sound like a lot, but it's really not.  You're probably going to do each of those things within your first hour or two, then rinse, lather, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.\\n\\nIt wouldn't be so bad if there were a lot of different ways you could do those things, or some ways you could do them well or poorly, some variety, some challenge, but there's really not.  Most actions are accomplished at the push of one or two buttons, with no challenge in them whatsoever.  What matters in whether you succeed or not is whether you've managed to scrounge up the necessary materials in your scavanging attempts at night, and that's mostly a matter of luck, not skill -- though I suppose there's a little bit of skill involved, in that you have to avoid getting caught.  But other than that, it's all up to the random number generator, as to what junk will be available for you to scavange.\\n\\nThe rest of the game is mostly just applying common sense, like eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired, take meds when you're sick, etc.\\n\\nOcassionally there's a moral dillema such as: should you give away your very scarce and valuable meds to some kids who come begging for them to save their sick mother?  If you do, you've done a good deed, and your characters won't feel guilty, if you don't, you'll have the meds for yourself, and might be able to use them to save your own lives or barter them for something critical to your survival, but your characters will feel guilty and sad, and that will hurt their chances of survival.\\n\\nWhile the occasinal moral dillemas and the game's atmosphere are nice touches, they don't make up for the lack of options and variety.  I like complex games, where you can make many choices and have tons of options.  Even games like Civilization have too few options for me.  And I dread mentioning this game in the same sentence as Civilization.  There's really no comparison.  This is a simple, even simplistic game.  A simple game with few options, but good atmosphere and a fair dose of sadness.  If you're ok with that, you might like it.  I got bored after the first half hour, yet stuck with it for another couple of hours anyway.  It wasn't worth it.\\n\\nThe developers of the game made a nice try, and it's refreshing to see a game that doesn't pull many punches when it comes to showing the downsides of war (though even it could have gone a lot darker and deeper), but it's really not nearly deep enough to keep my interest.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I was simply disappointed and use refund after 30min of gameplay and then some youtube watching. Why? This should be emotional experience and from the reviews I read, I should feel connected with character and their actions. But for me this simply didn’t work because of 2 reasons:\\n\\n1.\\tGame lacks some \"good production money\" - like for example Walking dead. I love characters in that game from the first minute and you can really tell what their personality is. In this game, everything you got is one photo and few sentences. There is no voices, no facial animation etc.\\n2.\\tGame mechanics. I\\'m simply not in the mood to find out if I should build a chair or a bed with given wood. Do I have enough wood to build everything? Should I choose wisely? Do I really need a bed? Should I build water dispenser first or oven is more important? In real life, there is so much more possibilities and you will know what you really need. In this game you have to learn (in hour? in 2? 5 hours?) just to \"please the game\" to move forward. I suppose that bad decision will result in sooner end (in fewer days). Should it evoke reality? Nah – in real life you will not decide between 5 actions. You will use all possibilities to survive. For example - when your character is hungry, there is the text \"hungry\" by his name. What does it mean? That he will die next day? Should I do anything to get him food? Or it\\'s fine to leave him hungry for 3-4 days? Can I decide to eat my friend? No – this game do not give you this possibility.\\n\\nI cannot help but to compare this game to walking dead. It’s very similar in terms of atmosphere, lack of resources and being attached to characters. But in WD, you have not to find out what to do or read it in some guide. You just simply absorb the atmosphere, story, personalities and are making hard decisions.\\n\\nAnd for 18,99€??? Are you kidding me? Only 4€ less than WD? But price is not the problem. I wouldn’t play this game even if it’s free. It’s simply not worth my time.',\n",

But then...\\n\\nThe weird thing is I was correct on the 2nd part of that line: fresh idears. Altough they have been done before in some other sim-like games. And other survival stuff. You can see this as a 2D version from State of Decay. Well you can better play that game. It\\'s a bit more balanced then this one. Let me explain...\\n\\nThis games puts you in a house and immediatly there is already one person slightly sick, with only bandages at your disposal. Scavenging the house doesn\\'t give you anything usefull most of the time. Scavenging requires luck ! Sometimes you are in luck but then you are almost instantly faced with the most common line in this game: \"You can\\'t make this, find some more stuff... But I\\'m to tired, let me sleep\".\\n\\nI have tried all 3 options in the 77min. that I played the game. First try, second try (diff. house thankfully) and \\'Create\\' own story. The \\'create\\' part is very poor, choose people and the base-camp. The last option even makes the violence come sooner. And you can\\'t defend yourself because of the lack of resources.\\n\\nIn the end you can see this as a very hard version of The Sims (any of them). Your team just isn\\'t fast enough in getting the things you need / making items you need to stay alive. And the game doesn\\'t give you much tutorial as well. If you still like this concept then please play State of Decay. It\\'s easier on the player and still gives a challenge. (Only difference is Zombies instead of War).',\n",

       "  'review': \"This War of Mine is a story of civilian survival in a war torn city.\\n\\nThe core mechanics of the game essentially come down to resource management. \\n\\nThe basic resource categories you need to manage come down to these broad groups:\\n\\n1. Food (ex. raw meat)\\n2. Building Materials (ex. wood)\\n3. Weapons/Utilities (ex. lock picks)\\n4. Happiness (ex. cigarettes)\\n5. Healing (ex. medication)\\n6. Bartering (ex. diamonds)\\n\\nThe game uses a cycle of two times: night and day.\\n\\nDuring the day you will do things like:\\n\\n1. Cook food\\n2. Distill alcohol\\n3. Sleep\\n4. Set mouse traps\\n5. Grow vegetables \\netc.\\n\\nDuring the NIGHT you will go out and SCAVENGE.\\n\\nThe night is the more interactive part of the game. During the night you will look at your map and determine where you would like to scavenge in the city. Some locations (such as the Garage) will be relatively safe and have people for you to barter with. Other locations (such as the Construction Site) may not be safe. You may need to bring a weapon or be prepared to not be seen. The entire goal of scavenging is to bring back food, materials, medications, etc. for your party back at base camp. \\n\\nCriticisms:\\n\\nOverall, I feel like the game becomes very grindy. The fact that you can only carry a limited amount of resources with you while scavenging is realistic yet tedious. You will have to spend multiple nights scavenging the same location in order to loot all of it. While this feels realistic and reasonable, in practice it just becomes monotonous and repetitive. \\n\\nDay time phase is a bit of a hassle and simply becomes a routine. You will make water every day. You will put tired people in beds every day. You will cook every day/every few days. Basically day time is just a monotonous time sync as you go through the motions of keeping everyone healthy. And that's honestly what day time is - going through the motions. It's not fun, it's not interactive, and you do the same thing nearly every time. It's disappointing. \\n\\nWhat I enjoy about the game:\\n\\nI absolutely love the concept - it's clever and I have to give the studio props on originality. It's fresh and something I have never seen before. I like the resource management concept of the game - unfortunately I just didn't care for the way it was executed (too monotonous/going through the motions).\\n\\n\\nFinal Word:\\n\\nThere is A LOT more depth to this game than I have presented here, but I have presented the basic gist of the title. While the game is unique and original, it lacks engagement. There isn't much of a story and the gameplay is simply too repetitive.  I'm very torn on this title, as I want to recommend it but the game just isn't fun. The gamplay isn't strong enough and it becomes repetitive very fast.\\n\\n5.0/10\",\n",

       "  'review': \"On the positive side, it's an emotionally loaded, immersive game that makes an attempt to illustrate the horrors of war. The artwork is beautiful as well. It's therefore an important game and I'm glad to have bought it and experienced it. However, as a game it's not very good and I cannot recommend it. I get it that the point of this game is illustrating the helplessness of the civilian in wartime, but they could have done a better job of the game's mechanics. I've had two playthroughs where the same thing more or less happened: someone was killed scavenging, someone else got depressed because of that and a third one died of sickness, then the depressed one starved. Scavenging and crafting are very frustrating and once someone is sad you are basically done for. In short, it's a beautiful and sad game, and you should get it if you care for the emotional content. You should definitely not get it for the fun.\",\n",

There's no variety in the game. It's just to get your survivors fed and that's it. Even if one of your survivors were ill of injured they could just sleep it off. The raiding system is a bunch of shit. You just need to put the minimum of 2 survivors and the raiders will lose. The amount of things you can do in this game is smaller than food portions at fancy restaurants. I am really really dissappointed. I am expecting an actual game not a shitty simulation. The core gameplay mechanics is horrible, it just hid lies behind this wall of lies. At first glance it looks like a really good game but in true fact it's nothing more than a overly hyped game made by shitty developers. This was a waste of my money. 2/10 would never reccomend\",\n",

All of the items in the game seem to be the same kind/amount every time you play. \\n\\nThe game does give you that eery feeling, and it does put you on the edge of your seat... until you realize how repetitive the game is. In 3.3 hours of play, I wound up doing the same thing over and over and over and over again - that's sad. \\n\\nAlso, the game just isn't fun. The game is cool for about 2 hours, then the novelty of it wears off and then you realize you sank  20 bucks into a game that gives you about 1.5 hours of 'new stuff' to do. Seriously. After about an hour and a half, you will have done just about everything there is to do in this game. Do that for 20 more, then you'll start to understand why it just isn't that great. \\n\\nIf this game was $5, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, because this feels more like an interactive novel than anything else, given its lack of content. \\n\\nSo that just about sums up what I don't like about this game and why I regret purchasing it. If you want a survival game that gives you an eery feeling, then get Project Zomboid or 7d2d.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Meh. I was really hoping for an immersive story here- but you really just get dropped into a resource management scenario without any context, and by that, I don't mean that I was looking for an explanation to anything that was going on in the war, etc. I'm a huge dark souls fan- ambiguity doesn't bother me. The gameplay itself just feels weak. I wanted this game to captivate me. I wanted to sit down and love this game so much that I didn't want to do anything else on my free time. I wanted to love the protagonists, and feel bereft by the loss of them. I wanted to be bullied by soliders, and made to feel weak. I wanted to see newcasts of incredible tragedies and happen across riots in the middle of the streets. I wanted to be marked a criminal for having to make hard decisions for my survival. I wanted to run for my life, and genuinely fear that my rickety house might fall in on top of me during a missile strike. I wanted to meet other civilians whose lives were torn apart by this war, and hear their stories, whether I could do anything to help them or not. I wanted to escape the city, or negotiate peace. But in spite of all that I hoped for, I was made to grind- to micromanage three characters than I felt no attachment to and sit quietly while they took several minutes to sift through piles of rubble, grab a couple resources, consume the ones my characters needed, rinse & repeat. I have Survival games in my library that work much better mechanically- so this didn't give me anything. It was boring me to tears for what little time I could stand to sit with it. And I tried to come back to this game, I read the reviews, I watched the videos again, hoping it could promise me that there was something more than what I was seeing, but there isn't. And I'm really bummed about that. I just can't pick this one up. It's too dull.\",\n",

If you\\'re into the genre, you already played it for hundred of hours (Minecraft, Don\\'t Starve, Terraria, etc.) but now you can enjoy it with a \"war\" depressing mood.\\nIt doesn\\'t make you sad and/or concerned like when watching a drama or a realistic war movie. It\\'s depressing like trying to cheer up depressed people : whatever energy you put into it, it will usually not work and you\\'ll feel like you totally wasted your time.\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine anyone saying \"I was a civilian in a warzone\" with someone answering \"I know what you lived, I played [i]This War of Mine[/i]\" without a big awkward moment raising, despite what say the 15\\'000 positive reviews of this game.\\n\\nIt is in no way realistic. Except if you think it\\'s possible to build a crowbar by assembling a few diggle ; and that a crowbar always breaks after being used 10 times (doesn\\'t anyone ever hold a real-life crowbar around here ?!?).\\n\\nIn my run, a girl died being shot (she ran to the wrong exit, thanks to the great interface of the game). The next day, everybody in my camp was sad from her death. But may I ask... How the hell did they know she was dead ?!? She sent them a SMS right before walking into the light ? You\\'ll tell me they assumed she was dead because she didn\\'t come back from her scavenger run. I\\'d then answer they really give up hope fast, and then I\\'ll add : why the hell they kept on saying \"she\\'s been shot like a dog\" ..?!? Her killers posted a picture on Facebook, maybe ?\\n\\nWorst, in term of gameplay : you can send only 1 person on a scavenger run per night, whatever the size of your group is. This means if your group gets bigger, it doesn\\'t let you scavenge more resources, raising the chance your group will starve. Great.\\n\\nPeople who says this game is realistic are probably the same ones who think that Jack Bauer is like a real counter-terrorist agent.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is one of the hardest decisions for a review I\\'ve had in a very long time.  Overall, I\\'m giving it a thumbs down primarily due to \"my\" perception of a lack of proper basic training provided by the developer and a community I found to be a majority of cruel fanboys.\\n\\nWhat I enjoyed:\\nFirst off, major kudo\\'s for the developing team for concieving and delivering a simulation of the realities of war, as told by the innoncent bystander.  So many war games give the player a sense of immortality and reward for senseless and mindless destruction, war is quite devistating and this simulator portrays this extremely well.  The graphics are quite good, they\\'re crisp and clear yet dark and hazy...  perfect!  The human stories you encounter help a great deal to pull you into the story line, well done.  The activities in the game seam quite realistic for the environment and was pleased to see that fear, concern, empathy, and hatred all exist within the encounters.  Each game is different, so there\\'s plenty of replayability in this simulator.  There\\'s not much help in the way of instructions, no list of commands to look up, you just get tossed into the game and have to figure it out.   I both liked this and hated it at the same time.  The first day you are introduced to several game play mechanics which do an excellent form of learning the game mechanics.  You\\'re digging, scavenging, building, breaking into all sorts of things.  You get used to the interface pretty quick, but there are several things it doesn\\'t teach you, which brings me to what I didn\\'t like...\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t enjoy:\\nSince there are no instructions (and again, I partially like that fact), I spent a good deal of time searching YouTube for instructional videos and tips.  Enduring several hours of listening to fanboys who love to hear themselves talk on and on about the most mundane of thoughts, I was able to pickup that in the game there is combat, the ability for characters to interact with each other, a few things that help you and your group suvive.  These abilities are not intuitive in the game and appear to have some combination of setting or events to make them happen that are not obvious, I\\'ve figured out combat finally, but little else.  Despite all the videos, all that I\\'ve seen is that you need to do these things, none cover HOW to do these things.  Aside from gameplay, these missing lists of commands would be very handy when setting up a custom game.  I am unable to create one because the map requires I pick some 24 city locations and I can\\'t get the interface to do anything more than toggle to loctions I pick and won\\'t maintain my selection.  \\n\\nSo like many other players have posted, the game sets you up to fail and it\\'s down right fustrating.  Having a house full of squatters/survivors you would think you could send out a large party to bring home several scavenged items.  Nope, only one person can go out for supplies a night, while the rest sit around and complain about how hungry, wounded, and sad they are.\\n\\nSome of the game mechanics don\\'t quite work as expected.  Once you steal items from a location, every repeat visit by \"anyone\" to that same location is treated as a theft even if you only scavanged and didn\\'t steal anything and further increases everyone\\'s sadness and it\\'s just a few runs before everyong is breaking down emotionally.\\n\\nOverall, it didn\\'t take long before I felt like playing this simulator was just pointless and a waste of my time.  Despite really being drawn to the game concept, I\\'m just not enjoying this game and as such can\\'t give it a thumbs up.',\n",

It has an addicting nature in the same way that other strategy games do, but it quickly becomes dull, which I suppose the makers of the game are going for. Unfortunately that doesn't make for a good game. I was doing well, and then I sent one of my characters on a foraging mission where he was killed due to the moronic combat system (for which, of course, there is no tutorial or practice mode). Before I could quit, it saved the game with the character dead, without my permission. All my progress was gone. The game sucks. Even $10 is too damn much.

After my second fail i looked up youtubers that explained how combat works.\\n\\nI played a game where i did my own team and chose 80 days. It set up everything before day 40 and the second half is completely boring, because i have nothing to do. I could sit home basically and just trade. There is no insentive to explore.

Good visuals, decent details and brilliant story... but for what it's worth...it isn't the best game you could possibly purchase. The characters aren't memorable... they're dull, no backstory or worth.. They're just there... Now I enjoy the locations of this game.. The supermarket, houses and such but you meet these raiders multiple times and they don't have any detail either.. Their portrayal is just to make the game more difficult and add length.. Did I mention length? Yes.. Yes.. I may have only a few minutes in this game but to some extent... there's length...it's long... yet repetitve.. Very repetitve.. Now this game has it's UP's and Down's but overall it is a very abstract and touching game but it's price is 20 dollars!?!?! This game is something I could purchase on the app store of my Galaxy for 5 dollars. If the game is on sale...go for it... Try to enjoy it... but HONESTLY.... This is the type of game I play on my iphone when I need to pass the time...then it'll be in my head for a while... Eventually I'll forget all the characters names, locations and... controls...

This character team instead of that one, different (of a total of two) base (maybe). The environments open up in a different order. Thats really it. It\\'s not anything where your going to experience your own game, your just going to experience the scripted one in a differently arranged set of modules. Doesn\\'t get you attached to the characters at all, really. One of the characters who I held as my favorite died, and I was only upset about the loss of his added carry weight. Oh, yeah.The combat is pretty jenky. AI will react instantly while you fumble through the mobile phone game-esque looking combat system. Looting is a little interesting, but even with the scripted looting areas there fails to be much of interest. Binary moral choices that are incredibly obvious (Literally, yes or no to \"help this person?\" most of the time). By an hour or so in, you\\'ll be murdering looters and starting fights not because your desperate for resources to survive and are doing so reluctantly, but because you are desperate to find something that might be fun and worth coming back to.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Story 5/5: You are a group of survivors that are stuck in this war between two factions, you aren't soldiers you are just citizens that got caught in the midst of this, over all the story is great and hotels and former places of residence you can sort of get a feel for what happened\\n\\nDifficulty Very Hard: The game is very brutal and it can be discourgaging at points, to try so hard and do so much. having built beds and put your fill of food and supplies only for half way in to have eaten and used up most and supplies get really hard to find and traders become your lifeline, 9/10 i've died due to hunger and the rest was to either gun shot wounds or things alike to which i like they went for a realistic feel for it...but i just felt going after bandits or even going against people with guns is just too much risk for such little reward, sure you get a gun but how much did you trade off for two gunshot wounds and to a now badly injuried survivor?\\n\\nAtmosphere 10/10: You can hear the nearby gun shots of the war at night and sometimes the dead silence and sounds of rats and animals going through the streets, during the day all you hear is the sound of the radio and footsteps of your survivors. overall the game really pushes you down into feeling that this next scavage to that new place, might end up killing someone since places can have bandits in it or you may take too long and when your survivor is coming back during the hours of the morning he can be shot down by the soldiers.\\n\\nOver all the game plays a high risk high reward, the risk being everything. you name it dying to countless amount of things, or even having survivors leaving the house due to not liking the group, so the game is fun but it plays a bit too highly on the risks so for a person like me who wants to complete things i cannot recommend the game since i found it like nails to a chalk board.\\n\\n5/10 final judgement.\",\n",

With this you might expect a 'restart from scavenge' option to remediate the ammount of game changing bullshit you may encounter, though you'd not be so lucky.\\n\\nConclusion - one of the better polished turds that you could buy and play with for a week.

But the worst part is not the difficulty, but simply that you will hate the characters so much you will wish you could set the house on fire.\\n\\nIt really isn't that the game is so terribly balanced, because there is that aesthetic out there where people wanna punish you for playing their games.  What begins with you trying to keep these people alive, trying to read their reactions to manage their delicate psyches, will end with you frustrated at every turn by their moping and complaining.\\n\\nIt's simply too hard to ever scavenge enough supplies to satisfy every need, even for one day.  As a result you never, EVER get ahead, you're just constantly catching up.  It would have been more interesting to let you luck into abundance, then make you a bigger target for raids.

It is absolutely bloody awful, i really do not care that im controlling civilians. I do care that apparently even thugs and homeless people are apparently capable of beating a fairly fit fireman in a knife fight. I do care that the game is absolutely dreadful with ranged combat in particular as if you have a melee weapon in your inventory too and someone gets too close, they will use their gun, you will use your knife despite having a shotgun at the ready. How bad could this be? at least 2 of my 3-4 game overs have been because of this god awful system. Yes, i employed stealth, yes i even got the jump on the homeless guy. Does that matter? NOPE, homeless man kicks the shit out of the fireman despite being malnourished.\\n\\nJust stay away. The system is so bad it actively pisses me off too much for me to actually care about whether or not my people are happy, i seriously couldn't care less about their hardships or problems when the combat system is so broken and crappy that it turns me off from the games story entirely.\",\n",

I mean this is war, people are going to steal and kill.  It doesn't matter if you steal parts or medicine from an old couple, no matter what you steal everyone in your camp will be depressed. When did all these people just mope around because you stole and it takes FOREVER to get them out of it (by the time you do they will probably be dead)\\n-By the time you get to build anything good the game is over\\n-Click to move everywhere no WASD\\n-You have to invest your resources in building things that don't seem to work.  It took 3 days of playing the guitar for one person to not be depressed\\n-Everything just takes way too long\\n\\nThe game is good but because it takes so long theres no satisfaction when you beat it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I really wanted to like this game for its unique theme- but unfortunately I found it hard to feel any empathy for the characters that inhabit Pogoren. The characterisation is just too shallow and its impact on the game too slight. As a result this really just plays like most other survival games and once you unearth the perfect build order every game becomes similar regardless of who constitutes your team. \\n\\nThe mechanics of this game also forces each scenario to take a long time (10+hrs) to complete. This length isnt indicative of content but instead a collection of minor nuisances. You can fast forward a day, for instance, but characters will not autocomplete assigned tasks during this time. Maybe you have one bed and allow 2 characters to each rest in it during the day- too bad you have to wait for one person to wake up before you can order the other to sleep. The same applies to work tasks- unless they are automatic (filtering water) then you must laboriously watch them perform tasks as tedious as rolling 40 cigarettes, digging up snow, rebaiting traps etc etc. The game needs a fast forward feature rather than one which skips the whole day.\\n\\nI have a number of other minor gripes i.e. the inventory button is next to the skip day button (often end up pressing the wrong one) and restriction to a single save file can easily add to what quickly becomes a tedious experience. As such I can't argue that this game has enough depth to support the number of hours it demands from the player.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Fuck this game. Fuck it hard right in the melancholy. This is the bleakest thing I\\'ve ever experienced. Three days in, I\\'m just starting to get on my feet but everyone is tired so I put two of them to bed for the night, they deserve it after spending all day furnishing their lovely home. I send the third guy out to get groceries (or scavenge, whatever) unfortunately he has a bizarre concept of time, or rather this game does. Days go by in minutes which is the complete opposite of how time seem to flow while playing it. I get that it has to go quicker than real-time but it\\'s maddening how quick it goes by in this, thus nameless-third-guy got caught out in the daylight, I don\\'t know what happened to him. It\\'s at this point I gave up.\\n\\nOn top of my sad story there I can\\'t play this game for shit. This game doesn\\'t tell you what anything is or how to do anything, you just have to figure it all out on ya todd. Some of it\\'s not so hard but there\\'s an awful lot of fucking miniature text in this game. What is it with modern games and insanely small writing?! I\\'d have better chance reading braille! \\n\\nAt the start of this game you are literally thrown into a huge but empty house with three people who like to complain a lot. You then search through rubble for 30 seconds and suddenly it\\'s night time. A menu gets thrown in your face asking you what you\\'d like to bring on your little scavenger hunt which is weird because nothing you have is usable for anything except taking up space in your backpack. Maybe you can use stuff in game, I don\\'t know because this game is the least intuitive thing I\\'ve ever laid eyes upon. I wish this game would give you some idea of what stuff is or what or what to do. Seriously, just a brief menu in the options that very quickly goes through the various menus and tells you how the game actually works would do wonders. Maybe then I could enjoy this game instead of feeling like an idiot all the time. And maybe I am just an idiot but strangely enough I don\\'t know how to survive in an impoverished war torn country, I guess I\\'ve lived a sheltered life.\\n\\nI mentioned in a previous review that some games just aren\\'t a persons cup of tea and that\\'s fine, it\\'s not worth bitching about and putting a game down for. This is a good example of that mostly, this type of game probably just isn\\'t for me and because I hate it I\\'m whining about it. However I believe this game has some legitimate issues, namely the tiny text and lack of any information about the mechanics.  Steam really needs to get a star rating system for reviews and maybe a minimum play time requirement to be able to post them. I don\\'t want to give it a straight up negative review because there is still some good but given that I only have two choices, thanks to Steam, I\\'m gonna have to Not Recommend this. If you can, play it before you buy it. If you don\\'t have a 50\" 1080p tv don\\'t bother, you won\\'t be able to read much.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This is a very interesting and innovative game with at least one never fixed serious bug and a weird and fantasy moral view, but fatally marred by a few bugs and misjudgements by 11Bit.  First, after being sold for a year they still haven't made taking essential survival goods from bandits and soldiers guilt free - and too much guilt causes charaters to hang themselvers.  But you can kill them without guilt.  Crazy.\\n\\nAlso, the developers have over focused on guilt, depression and suicide as the normal result of being as ruthless as such a situation requires.  Most cities and towns have enough food for less than a week.  In order to survive, you have to take food and cause others to die.  Just reality.  Also, in such a situation cannabalism is what helps some surivive.  Not much talked about but it is reality.  It's winter, you are literly about to stave to death and happen upon a frozen corpse.  What is the rational response.  Said to taste just like pork.  You eat and you and yours survive.  \\n\\nAlso, the make you own character system is about a third of what you need to produce an original, interesting character.\\n\\nFixed this would be a five star game, instead I give them one star for taunting us with a potentially great game, but deeply flawed to the point of funless to play\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I cant help but feel that most of the reviews/recommendations for this game (at the time of writing they are 95% positive) are based on morality. A) Its donating to charity and B) Its highlighting the plight of innocent bystanders suffering during a war. An issue that\\'s in the forefront of the media recently due to the Syrian refugees.\\n\\nWhilst i find the backstory and scenario commendable, and making people think about these issues applaudable, i think the *game* should be rated as such and not on whether or not we sypathise with real-world victims of war.  And as such i can not recommend this game. At the time of writing i have 5 hours played. It feels like 50. I wanted to quit after the first hour but persevered. It did not get better. Its tedious, monotonous, repetitive. Only 1 person can scavenge one location per night, regardless of how much time you spend there. The quantities and variety of materials involved are such that the actual gameplay is just tedious, frustrating inventory management. The only replayability comes from the fact that since there is actually no guidance or tutorial at all, the only way to learn your options is by your mistakes.\\n\\nIt is, when all is said and done, an interactive story, as some \"games\" are. Ive been gaming for 35 years. It has no real game mechanics and when you seperate the actual gameplay from the thought-provoking scenario theres really not much there. If you want an experience similar to watching Schindler\\'s List, the you may enjoy it. If you want an actual game then you probably wont. \\n\\n4/10\\n\\nAnd if you think i\\'m just a heartless brute... i cry watching \"An American Tail\", (Somewhere out there...). I just dont want my \"games\" to be about an emotional story, i want them to be about gameplay.',\n",

       "  'review': \"While I can see the appeal for some, I can't in good conscience recommend this game.\\n\\nWhy?  Absolutely no tutorial and yes it needs one.  No way is it intuitive enough to get the nuances without one.  For me my crafting table was destroyed on the 2nd night, apparently I'm the only one this has ever happened to as I played a few more nights and with searching online could find no way to get a crafting table back...  start again....\\n\\nWhile you have 3 characters to control at the start it's most tedious and boring.  Very little activity on screen and it's all about the story and the struggle, so I guess if that sounds appealing maybe this is your game.\\n\\nShort summary'\\n\\nPRO'S\\n- arguably stylistically attractive in the graphics department\\n- morally a great concept and testing of your choices in the game\\n\\nCON's\\n- not intuitive to learn to play\\n- lots of 'waiting' for things to happen\\n- feels very turn based even though it's kinda real time\\n- no actual 'save game' feature, seems if you exit takes you back to the start of the day you're on\\n- interaction options with NPC's severely limited\\n\\nI had been intrigued by this game since release and couldn't justify full price.  Was finally tempted for a $7 steam special to buy it.  Gave it a chance and for me found it wanting.  Not $7 worth for me, felt it could have been so so so much more and just wasn't.\",\n",

Sick overnight and injure during no raid.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]My Experience[/h1]\\nFirst day no supplies, so send all people scavenging, nope only just one. Spend the next couple ingame days trying to figure out what can be built by wasting 3-4 of the 8 hours walking around your house. Ok if I can only send one person then those extra 18/30 squares of space means I can upgrade my carry limit - no, the max is  set for each character and the best has 15, those other squares are there to waste screen space . First combat, died because I did not click the button on the far left to go from scavenge to \"fight\". Pissed I can\\'t reload, so kill the guys who got my best scavenger. Now they moan stealing from the dead people instead of killing - wrong priority. Five hours in, double click runs and the icons above the characters head is interactive and not a Sim bubble. Bring out notepad to remember where each tool is needed for scavenge locations and material requirements to stop wasting build time walking to each workshop. Can\\'t determine why all characters are getting worse morale; build radio, nice chairs, beds. Nope still sad. Next day why is this guy injured he was only sleeping. Alt+F4 prior to day end save and this time he got ill. One character leaves and the other two suicide. Turns out, one book is not as good as many. Sleeping well and relaxing to music are not enough you must have books or you will die. I did notice afterward that the status screen for the group had a warning on not enough books. The next game I do better but get stuck on an upgrade to get guns but the only place with the material I need is in a high danger zone. The horrible fighting mechanic: click and wonder when the action is done to click again while not clicking to fast or reset the action. The locations have material types but not the actual counts even when it has been fully explored more than once. Need that last \"component (cog)\" but all the locations only have \"parts (bolts)\"; hope you remember. If I have to bring out a pad to remember what the game should have readily available, guess when an item is one time use , and wonder when my clicks are followed; then the mechanics and design are the problem.\\n\\nTutorial instructions; every game needs them, no matter how simple you think the game has been built.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I would usually recommend this game, but due to borderline game breaking bugs I think it may be best to hold off buying entirely (unless the devs fix the bugs) unless you\\'re really into the experience. I bought it on sale, so I got out my money\\'s worth even with the bugs.\\n\\nGood:\\n* very atmospheric game: the good strories, music and art style play into this\\n* the game play (assuming it would be bug free) is generally decent\\n* runs pretty well on my machine\\n\\nBad:\\n* once you\\'ve figured out the game mechanics, it becomes more boring farily quickly. I think it could benefit from heavier randomization, in particular the zones themselves and where to find loot in them. Some zones have two variants, but it still feels very moot\\n* the controls are clunky at times (i.e. in combat when multiple targets at the same point it becomes hard to target someone, and generally unresponsive, in the base you sometimes select characters you don\\'t really want to)\\n* and the bugs...\\n\\nBugs (spoilers):\\n* It appears characters can just die by freezing just a day before you win, the bug has been acknowledged by the devs afaik\\n* sometimes characters will just disappear permanently (not talking about suicide or sending them away, they just disappear without any kind of notifcation or anything. Apprently related to accepting missions)\\n* people get upset over \"stealing\" items that don\\'t belong to anyone anymore (i.e. killed people) or containainers turn into \"steal\" from \"take\" for no reason (not very immersive either)\\n* enemy AI is exploitable (I\\'ve had them in places climb a ladder, get shot upstairs, fall down and repeat the entire process; or just shooting them from above with similar results, ai just sitting there waiting to get shot)\\n\\nConsidering the goal is to keep your survivor group together and alive, loosing someone over a bug is a no go. In particular if you consider this has rouge-like savegames, loosing someone 8-10 hours into a savegame that doesn\\'t have any restore point because of a bug I consider game-breaking. Adding in the wonky controls it can make for a rather frustrating experience.\\n\\nIf you still want it for the style and experience, I\\'d at the very least recommend getting it on a sale. I don\\'t really think the full price (about 20€ at the time of writing) is justified for the current quality and content.',\n",

Other moral choices like whether or not to kill this rich family trivially boiled down to \"Will it help me?\".\\n\\nThe mood mechanic infuritated me.

Granted, this game isn\\'t a game about killing but flopping down on the floor in Very Hungry state after just retrieving a bag of food from the dead people\\'s house - that\\'s idiotic! These direct cause-and-effect behaviors further reminded me that the characters in this game are just encapsulations of data visualized with pixels and sounds.\\n\\nOverall, I couldn\\'t immerse myself into this game.

       "  'review': 'It was certainitly an interesting game, but I don\\'t reccomend it because I swear it\\'s trying way too hard to be edgy and depressing. For example, you kill ANYONE and the entire fucking team get depressed and starts questioning life and shit. I started my second playthrough, and was sneaking through a church and found this guy bragging about killing the priest who shelterd the sick and homeless during the war. The man was taking all of the church\\'s stuff after killing everyone there, and when he spotted me tried to shoot me. So I stabbed the little shit to death. I take what I need, and go home. Hell, I even sparred another group of people a house over who ended up chasing after me with an AK-47, and when I had the chance to stab one, I decided to let them go. Then I get home and character is \"depressed\" and won\\'t stop moaning about how ashamed she was of what she did. Come on, that\\'s ridiculous. To make things worse, the rest of the team becomes sad. I can understand people getting sad when you steal from the elderly, but I genuinly can\\'t engage even the most bloodthirsty tyrants without everyone getting sad. Stop trying to make me feel bad for killing murderers, because I don\\'t feel bad about it. Additionally, the difficulty is fun at first, but just gets stupid at some points. It gets to the point where your people are getting sick and injured for no reason. I keep a furnace with kindling in it 24/7 to keep my place warm, yet everyone gets sick because of the cold 2/3 of my team ended up terminally ill as well. I put people on gaurd every night, and build defnses, yet we get raided every night. A hard game is fine, but a cheating game is not. If I can\\'t counter these problems, why put them in and pretend I can counter them? An interesting idea, but it needs some polishing before I can reccomend it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Even though most reviews applaud the emotional choices you have to make at times, I failed to recognize any of these situations. The characters feel like cardboard plates to me. The only personality can be found in their character cards, which you barely read. The lines they speak are few and repetitive, as well as not reflecting their \\'personality\\'. As the characters feel like mindless robots under the control of my mouse, I felt absolutely no sympathy when one of my survivors died on day 14, nor do I feel any compassion for any of the other remaining survivors in \\'loot\\' houses. It may just be me, but somehow the game doesn\\'t trigger my \\'feels\\' knob.\\n\\nThe slow pace of the game doesn\\'t help either in getting me exited. Clearing rubble before obtaining a shovel takes enough time to get a cup of coffee IRL. The trips back to the exit and the subsequent cut scenes are long enough for me to take out my phone and browse reddit for a good minute or so.\\n\\nGOod things about the game? I suppose that the art and music are quite fitting to the theme at first, but I was quickly desensitized to them and muted the music. After a while the idea of being in a war slipped my mind and I felt I was playing a grinding game to obtain just 5 items: Wood, parts, components, meat and water. You don\\'t need more. The additional items just come as a bonus when grinding for the essentials, or as a result of trade. The complexity of the game is very low, as it doesn\\'t really excite my to play any further. Some days, were so useless, I came back from the night, put them in bed, and pressed \"End day\". I couldn\\'t be bothered by anything else. If only you could send multiple scavengers a night, so it might be worthwhile to accommodate more people whose only purpose is to eat your food.\\n\\nIn conclusion, nice music and art style for the first hour or so, then becomes repetitive and tedious to play. Do yourself a favor and buy Don\\'t Starve (which even has a multiplayer!)',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit: Played for another few hours, just to be absolutely sure I wasn\\'t missing something. \\n\\nEventually a place cropped up to barter...great! Oh, they keep coming. Around 80-90% (no exagguration) of my locations were occupied by other survivors, thugs, or military. There was nothing left to do but \\'be the bad guy\\' and resort to stealing from these people which gets really difficult once they start pointing guns. There was no way you could build all the cool stuff in a reasonable time-frame especially when you got looted, despite having men on guard, every odd night. \\n\\nThe exchange rates on items are downright extortionate as even cigarettes, advertised as being needed badly by the army, are worth little to nothing if you just want a bit of metal to build the 30 metal upgrade for your workbench. If you carried nothing but metal with your best scavenger you can manage 60 in a night but often you won\\'t find that much and you need around 20 wood for the upgrade too which can only stack in twos. You need food every day because everyone is hungry every day, fair enough, but you need your water which costs metal for filtration and you need to burn your wood or metal to make fuel to cook one meal for one person!\\n\\nWhat I also noticed was that survivors do not sleep on their own if you skip the day, if you get your fourth survivor and only have a couple of beds, which can work if you alternate, then you will need to sit and watch your survivors stand still or sleep until they wake up in order to swap people into the bed. Why do I have to do that? I\\'m not building anything, nothing is happening, I don\\'t want to sit and wait until this other guy wakes up so I can put the other to bed. \\n\\nIt\\'s so frustrating and not in a difficult sense, you\\'re just a clown juggling things until you see what you drop first. I didn\\'t feel much sense of adventure despite the NPCs I encountered and nobody is willing to do you any favours. Why couldn\\'t they have added some quests or something? A favour for a favour; I only had one instance of this where a guy wanted me to open a door...the way I was going. I opened it, he let me have a few items and that was that, I never saw anything else like that apart from kids at the door going \"help our mother\" where they just keep taking your medication or food. I\\'d rather persistent quests instead of all this bartering where I\\'m stealing goods, selling them back to people, buying other goods that are a pain to find and so on. \\n\\nAlso why can\\'t I take someone with me to scavenge? Why do I keep meeting groups of thugs, bandits, survivors, out on location doing the same thing as me but I can only take one person? It just prolongs something that doesn\\'t need to be there and isn\\'t fun. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\nEat, Sleep, Take All, Repeat.  \\n\\n\\nNo way to \\'befriend\\' other survivors. In one instance I was seen at the front door of another\\'s base and a guy ran out and stabbed me as protection! \\'Thankfully\\' he only stabbed me a few times and let me go so consider that \\'warning\\' heard loud and clear. I thought this game was meant to show the realities of war or something? Since when do people stab you and consider it a warning, why didn\\'t he just wave the knife around and tell me to bugger off? I came across another guy who was having a real hard time, mourning the death of his friend. \"Don\\'t mind me, I\\'m just paying my respects\" or some such he said- right, can I talk to him? No. Maybe I would\\'ve liked to invite this poor sap over to our house seeing as I\\'m meant to feel sympathy for the poor bastard whose friend died and was fittingly(?) buried at the back of a gas station.\\n\\nOn the topic of other survivors, I had one come to my front door and trade with me. Now, I\\'d collected some quality tobacco and coffee. The item description says that these things are the hot buns of the market, everyone wants them, they\\'re so valuable in these times of war. I figure I need some metal to make a bed seeing as I built a rainwater filter and that was it for the day. So, I try to get a few of his abundance (30) of metal. Apprantley coffee isn\\'t worth shit because I pretty much had to trade all my coffee and tobacco for barely any metal- I tried to trade for wood instead and got the same result! I traded anyway, I wanted another bed up; but then the survivor, who was just complaining about having no bed, is now crying we have no tobacco- I\\'ve never seen him smoke! Give me a break. For a game that gets praise for being some emotional experience there\\'s certainly a lack of emotional interaction, my survivors never nattered to each other and only spoke to themselves randomly saying things such as \"We\\'re going to make it\" or \"I would love to sleep in a bed\". Consider me provoked. \\n\\nSurvivors spend most of their time sick or wounded and, at times, you can\\'t do anything about it. \"Bruno needs bandages\" from around the start and there\\'s none to be seen. I never once came across a medical supply apart from herbal medicine and Bruno simply died along with my scavenger who sure learnt his lesson about coming to the front door. \\n\\nThe crafting is so frustrating seeing as you can only get so much a night which usually amounts to one or two objects, and even then you need more to use them. For example, rainwater needs a filter, you need filtered rainwater to cook a meal (5 for one meal, you get 4 per collection and filters cost a few metal as well as being one-time use). There\\'s not much else to the game, it just felt really repetitive where I\\'m putting people to bed or making them eat a meal. Then, after that exciting task, I go to the night and scavenge which is simply clicking on a hand icon and hitting \\'take all\\'. Sometimes, maybe pretty frequently, you\\'ll come back to have been raided. Either your shit is gone, your people got smacked hard defending it, or maybe a combination of the two!\\n\\nIt\\'s just not fun. There\\'s some initial grip to it where you\\'re excited to be surviving in these times of war but God does it drag on. Why survivors start wounded and sick is beyond me, and if you get RNG\\'d on your loot then the game is pretty much done for you. There\\'s no actual relationships developing and your survivors just exist together in the plainest sense, a house of individuals with a shared inventory. There\\'s a much better game out there like this, except with a zombie theme, called Zafehouse. You\\'d think I\\'d have the same criticisms of Zafehouse as I do This War of Mine but it\\'s considerably cheaper and less empty in a more general sense, it was just fun. This game just made me want to go and play that instead, where I actually had a fun time. I\\'d recommended giving Zafehouse a look before This War of Mine.',\n",

       "  'review': \"If you do plan on buying this game regardless, for a better experience try pressing escape on your keyboard instead of exit on the in-game menu. Most of my crashes were caused by pressing that. Now, onto the review.\\n\\ntl;dr: This is a really neat experience, but the stability issues, a few bugs, and the god-awful combat system just brings the entire game down so much that it just wasn't enjoyable for me.\\n\\nWhat it does right: I really love what they're going for here. A look into the life of what happens around war instead of just playing the soldiers fighting in it is something I've never seen a game do before. You get to experience having to make extremely hard choices just to maybe have enough supplies to live through the next through days. This game really makes you think hard about what you're willing to do to scrape by. Resources are extremely scarce; I found myself thinking I had enough of one thing just to run out of it the next day. Overall it does a great job of immersing you in the situation and putting you up to difficult decisions, like stealing from or just outright murdering innocents just to be able to survive, or going up against heavily armed thugs or soldiers to maybe see if they've got something you desperately need.\\n\\nIt also keeps things simple, so you don't have to spend ages learning the mechanics of the game, but also isn't so simple that there's no level of complexity you have to adapt to just to be able get what you need through higher level crafting and trading. It's accessible enough to not push you away in the beginning, but has enough depth to make sure you're still struggling to  the end, and in this case it works really well.\\n\\nWhat it does wrong: Despite the really enjoyable core mechanics, some things really break this game for me. For starters, the stability is awful. It took me a couple of hours just to get this game into a semi-playable state, as I had to look up multiple fixes that didn't even work, and play through multiple crashes and freezes until I could identify the main problem and try to work around it. Even  then the game would freeze up on the scavenging screen ocassionally, and it still had the chance of crashing on menus that I couldn't exit out of like I mentioned above. \\n\\nThe crashing wouldn't be as much of a problem if you could save more often, but the game only saves after a full day and night of scavenging, meaning that if you crash at any point during, you have to play that ENTIRE day over again. Needless to say, it can get pretty frustrating if you've done a lot to your house or got pretty far in scavenging that day.\\n\\nSpeaking of infuriating bugs, on the very last night I had a bandit phase through two floors and immediately spot me. I don't mean he just ran up to me... no, he literally passed through the floors in a straight line to see me. This really just soured the entire experience at the very end and completely broke any solid immersion I had. This is an eight month old game that is a full retail release. I could forgive it if it was early access, but things like this and the constant crashing are really unacceptable. \\n\\nThis goes onto my next point of the awful combat. If you can, just avoid it completely. It seems entirely random if you or your opponent dies or not, especially if it involves guns. I've had characters just stand straight up from cover before and stop shooting just to get shot to death. The simplistic system that worked so well for everything else makes the combat absolutely awful in just about every circumstance. The only saving grace is leading them into an instant backstab from a hiding place, but like I said in my last paragraph, even this could lead to a frustrating experience.\\n\\nAfter everything is said and done and I've completed the game, I could probably forgive the combat and give this game a positive review, but the sorry state of the game's stability and bugs make it an unenjoyable experience. If you have the patience of a saint and want a really good and different experience, you should definitely buy this game. Otherwise you'd probably be better off waiting until the devs can actually fix everything before you spend your money on this.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I like the Idea of showing how war is like to civilians in real life, while we are usually running around and killing thousands of bad guys, not wasting one thought on civilians - apart from when rescuing them is an objective. I like the graphic style of WoM, which fits the setting quite well. And how every decision affects people around you in some way makes you think every time what is the right or the wrong thing to do (which isn`t really a question as you will see further below). But (and that is a big one): In the end that all does not work out. For a game like this, which wants to catch the cold and threatening atmosphere of a shelled city, atmosphere is crucial and so is the music. It should be tense and kind of pulling you down. But instead is it more like someone is playing nice quiet tunes at a campfire. So for me the atmosphere just does not fit the setting, which is a big con to me. In addition, the game mechanics are repetitive and too simple. Watching a character ditching for the 20th time for a minute is just not exiting. Another  thing I disliked, was the attitude of the characters you play. No matter what you do, the other chracters are pissed off because of your actions. For example even though they were starving and you brought food by stealing it, they will be mad at you anyway. They all seem to be noble selfless knights, with no will to survive what so ever. Of course some people are like that, but war is about survival and sometimes you have to do things that are not nice to survive. It would have made the game experience way better if the gameplay represented that. It would also have been interesting if chracters in your group had different opinions on that, so conflicts between them may arise. But they are always personalisations of higher morals. That is unrealistic on the one hand and boring on the other, because there is always a clear right and a wrong, which limits the possibilities of playing. \\n\\n2.6 hrs on record. What does this tell you? That I really wanted to like this game but just couldn`t. I A ambitious attempt on showing war in games more realistic, but which does not work out because of the lack of motivating game mechanics and atmosphere. If the possibility to return a game had existed back then, I would have returned it. There will not be more time on my record than these 2.6 hrs.

       "  'review': \"game is fun mostly, but sometimes i went nuts because this game doesnt have save/load function Which means if you made a wrong move (bad trade, team member died from bandits attacks), you gonna suffer the rest of your game. I really dont like it, for example, i was doing really good, had a good shelter, lots of stuff in there, but two consecutive night when i was exploring unvisited places, my men got killed by sneaky bandits.  Without  good scavenger, there is no way i can continue playing and survive, and all my previous efforts for this particular gameplayer goes in vain.\\n\\n----\\nupdates:  the more i play the more i hate this game , actually.\\n\\n1, no save/load is really a dumb move for developer. For completing a typical 40 days survival period, I need to spend 5-6 hours, yes i have 18 hours in steam record, but just 1 beaten game, why? got 2 failed games i already spent 4hours on each, but made mistake , and didnt survived at the end This is frustrating and pointless time-consuming. Developer just expects me to navigate from day1, from scratch all over again and again?   Even hardcore games like Dark Soul allows me to retry in which I failed.\\n\\n2, notice huge amount of gameplay guides in community hub?  this game has no tutorial, no help section, developer just drops you into wild west and laugh at your failure. Again, no save/load, so play carefully, any mistake you make would ultimately send your hours time investment into trash can (didnt survive)\\n\\nI'd love to replay it if this game has a proper save/load function, no reason wasting time like that. I am buying an indie game, not a hardcore mode Diablo 3.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I was lured in by the hype and massive amount of positive reviews, but ended up being seriously disappointed in the game. It looks like those many thousands of positive reviews are there mainly for the –message- the game sends, not the gameplay itself. Even the most helpful review listed for this game is just a few sentences poking at how depressive the game is, not an actual review.\\n\\n \\nThe first thing I noticed about this game was it looked like a direct clone of another steam game called –Deadlight- with a smidgen of resource gathering/management from another game called\\n-deadly 30-. Both of those games are also side scrollers, I’m pretty sure a Dev or two for this game pulled ideas from those two and or others to make this one.\\n\\nOther reviews say the graphics are good for this game, but Deadlights is much better in my opinion for a post apoc game and it came out years ago and Deadlight has more scenes/scenarios while this game is confined to destroyed buildings.\\n\\n \\n****Spoiler warning*****\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHere’s a list of things I came across while playing this game that are head scratchers or just don’t make any sense.\\n\\nThe survivors know how to make a radio, but no one has the skills to make crude weapons to defend themselves from early raids while you are cleaning out your shelter. The survivors need to collect materials to make a workshop to make crude weapons. Soooo the survivors have the skills to make a workshop, but can’t make simple crude weapons until they can build a workshop. Wait..What?\\n\\nAll the survivors start out with nothing but their empty backpacks. Hmmm\\n\\nI guess the player is supposed to assume either all of your survivors were caught off guard by an attack somewhere else, but they only managed to grab their “empty” backpacks or all your survivors were caught by bandits as a group and all their belongings were taken nearby, though the bandits let them go free until they reached the shelter. But this conflicts with an early first encounter.\\n\\nA First early encounter at the shelter immediately followed with a groan from me. A Knock on door asking for help to carry an injured person home from being shot by a sniper. Sorry to hear that, but no I can’t help you at this time, I don’t know you and this could be a trap.\\n\\nOhh but wait, after you decline to help you’re told this was your “neighbor”. Oook, how did I the player know you were my neighbor? But wait, didn’t you as the survivors just find this place as a shelter? How is this person your neighbor if you just arrived with not even so much as a 2x4, knife or scrap of food on any of you? ugh\\n\\nObservation - During play, no survivor is strong enough to lift a table/chair or knock over a damaged wooden dresser and smash it to the ground for wood/fuel, they must craft an axe to break things down to collect wood/fuel.\\n\\nObservation-When scavenging, you can commonly find rare items like lock picks but more common items like hammers, knives(even a common butter knife that could be used as a weapon) are nowhere to be found. It also appears every radio and alarm clock has been destroyed during the war and one must be made, since you can’t even trade for one, though parts for one can be found.\\n\\nObservation-How is it that every occupied area around you has people with guns, but everyone in your group is bare handed with not so much as a shiv/knife or a 2x4 when they start.\\n\\nItems like crowbars break down after repeated use on wooden doors in destroyed buildings. What? I could understand a shovel breaking because of a wooden handle, but a crowbar? Saws are also a one-time use item. wow\\n\\nObservation- With Ai NPCs, if they have guns It’s always shoot on sight if you try to scavenge a new area with people there. There’s no “hey who are you, get out of here or I’ll shoot” “It’s hey someone’s there, you’re dead” BANG BANG\\n\\nNo chance for “Oh, sorry I was not aware this area was already occupied, I’m leaving”\\n\\nObservation-How is it possible for an NPC to know you stole something from them if you show up with a different character than the one used to steal? Silly\\n\\nWhy does snow that you collect at your front door need to be melted/purified at your cooking stove when you have a wood heater that is heating your shelter?\\n\\nThe survivors can only send out one scavenger per night no matter how many survivors you have and you can scavenge only one place per night even if you are done scavenging in a short time. If you clean out an area in an hour, you’re done for the rest of the night since you’re confined to that building/area all night. No other areas close buy/next door can be scavenged until the next night even if you have 4 hours to spare, you have to end the night or basically twiddle your thumb for X amount of hours until it’s time to go home.\\n\\nThe game tries to get you to open your shelter up to more survivors for you to manage/take care of beyond your initial starting group. But there is no point in doing so from a survival standpoint unless you want to read their profile/back story. When I became self-sufficient, food was still scarce/hard to come by with just 3 people. Adding more survivors only puts you in a worse position and there is nothing for the extra survivors to do but sit around, always be cold/hungry/tired or get wounded in a raid. If you could actually use the extra survivors to go scavenging, I could see the point in adding them to your shelter.\\n\\nThe survivors can’t go out in the daytime, there appears to be a 24 hour curfew. So for a war that’s been going on for years, there are no temporary trade markets during the day to trade at. Strangely you hear on the radio there are supplies like coffee being dropped off, so why are none of the survivors allowed to leave during the day to get some of this humanitarian aid?\\n\\nIn game time goes by in 10 minute increments, with each increment occurring in less than 10 seconds, somewhere around 8 seconds. So if you do have stuff to do, you need to do it quickly before 8pm. The problem with that is that it takes one of your characters 30 game minutes to walk up 1 flight of stairs or go from one floor of your shelter to another. So if you want to go up 3 stories in your shelter to build/make/break something, it will take you 1 and a half game hours to walk up those stairs. This does not include time to actuallty build/break your item. Crazy stuff.\\n\\nI completed the game in 42 days without killing anyone simply by concentrating on becoming self-sufficient, there’s no need to kill any NPCs unless that is what you want to do or risk. The worst thing I did was steal some supplies from the old couple.\\n\\nWhile the message the game is trying to send is a good one and the charity part is appreciated, the actual game play is unrealistic and is incredibly repetitive after about day 20. It would be even more so if the crime wave did not occur to mix things up after day 10. Don’t be lured in by the massive amount of recommends and wait for a sale, the $20 is too high for the limited amount of content provided.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Okay.... I am trying to take a deep breath and calm myself before I write the review...\\n\\nHere is the truth.  I LOVED this game, so why would I rate it down?  The artistic value of the game is to be revered.  The game-play is fun, addictive like crack, and balanced all the way through.  It is a survival game that makes you care for your characters because with a little extra thought, proper preparation, and a careful use of resources, the game can be the PERFECT challenge all the way through.  Not so much that you put it away from dying all the time, but just enough so you feel that you can learn from your mistakes when you take the wrong person looting and get him/her shot, push too far into a bandits\\' base for loot and  get someone killed, or become a bandit yourself and watch your characters hate themselves for it.  It all works!  So WHY in god\\'s name am I rating this game down.... SIGH.  I will tell you at the end, because the ending is is why I am now jaded.\\n\\nThis game has this unique blend of survival and platformer elements.  The combat is a little wonky, but this is not an action game.  This is a survival game that pushes your moralities to the limit: do you send off one of your characters for a day to help your neighbors who in the past have shown you kindness, or do you turn your back and keep to yourself so you can keep your base safe while looting?  Killing is not taken lightly in this game.  Most of the characters are not fighters.  They have never shot at anyone before and you must weigh how stressful it will be on them to out-right murder a person for his/her loot.  sometimes it might be best to come back from a night of looting with a bag half full and a heart that is not broken.\\n\\nThe characters themselves are all full of life and special in their own way.  One or two are trained in combat, and do not feel the pressure of killing so long as they  are not killing innocents.  Some are good cooks, others are handy-men that  use less resources to build and craft with.  Others can keep children calm and tend to wounded while others are small but stealthy, making them ideal for nightly looting runs\\n\\nLooting is done so well.  Your characters feel no pain from looting bandits, but question themselves for steeling from an elderly family.  The stealth mechanics are solid and intense at many times.  I managed a play-through without ever shooting at anyone. (apart from defending my base from bandits.  Can\\'t be controlled and it doesn\\'t affect your characters depression)  I chose to help all  who asked of it, but stole when I needed to as long as I did not leave someone for dead by doing so, and yes there is a difference between taking what you need in this game, and taking everything, and your character will reflect on that.  Limited backpack space and time turn scavenging into a strategic race for time as you decide whether or not to bring a crowbar and lock-pick, or save the space and only take what loot is easily accessible while scouting out threats, bared and locked doors and piles of obstructing rubble that can be cleared on a succeeding night.  Rubble that can be moved without a shovel,  but will take a lot of your precious time if you chose to do so.\\n\\nKeeping your team rested and fed feels just right, and the amount of given resources is remarkable.  Too big of a team means that more food will be needed than can be provided.  Too small and your base will be raided while you are out looting and sleeping.  Choosing who sleeps at night, who sleeps on a bed or off a bed, and who sleeps during the day can\\'t be taken lightly.  Wounded characters will take rest, first-aid, and time to heal.  A few nights passed that I had to keep everyone at the base and be frugal for a day so the group could recover.\\n\\nThe bartering system is well thought out.  There is a traveling tradesman that will show up every few days with goods that can be exchanged for home made moon-shine, home grown vegies, looted and self-made meds and anything else you want to trade.  You can also take specific items with you on  \"looting\"  runs to trade with the military, other survivors and even bandits.  Each group seeks different items, and you are not likely to come home with a full backpack, but you will have exactly what you set out for, and some times that is more important.\\n\\nThere is also a winter that you must survive.  OMG was it intense.  Keeping enough fire wood burning to keep your characters healthy while still having enough to cook food and craft pushed me to the limit more than once.  I was taking an ax to furniture just to keep the fires going.  Brilliant!  The winter is not too long and comes on at a nice pace so that you have time to trade for or scavenge what is needed in time build a heater for your base. (hint: UPGRADE IT EMEDIATELY!)\\n\\nAnd lastly, the DLC for this game is heart warming to say the least.  It doesn\\'t add much content to the game, but %100 of the proceeds goes to the War Child charity, and that\\'s just groovy.  The dlc adds some wall-art to the in-game levels.\\n\\nNow... After so much praise, why did I rate this game down?!\\n\\n[b]Small spoilers ahead[/b]\\n\\nI WILL TELL YOU WHY!\\n\\nI worked my tail off keeping my crew alive!  I helped EVERYONE that asked of it.  I killed no one, and only stole when I was desperate, and even then I took only what I needed and never left anyone to die.  I brought in a character in need when he asked and he survived with the rest of us to the end....  THE END!\\n\\nThe war lasts 45 days max, some people don\\'t like this, I don\\'t mind it so much.  It can end some time before that, but its random.  If you have built a radio, it will keep you informed of whats going on.  INCLUDING THE WEATHER!\\n\\nDay 44 roles around.  I have mastered my team and have prevailed through dozens of bandit attacks, and winter included.  I have an outright stock pile of weapons, ammo, food, supplies, crafting tables, trade goods, and FIRE WOOD.  The forecast from the radio, which you will see in the screen shot, called for \"warm days ahead.\"  Winter was about a week in the past at this point and there is only one winter in this damn game!\\n\\nI leave my base on the 44th night to do some light looting because I wanted to pass the time and grab some last minute stuff in the case that there is some end game fight or something.  I leave with  \"WARM DAYS\"  in the forecast and a thermostat that reads 20 Celsius.  That is hot for this game, it starts around 15 C.  I get back to -5 C and a team that has frozen to death........... What in the flying F**K is that crap?!?!\\n\\n*edit* Turns out this is a bug that the devs have not felt inclined to fix.  With this knowledge, I will keep the thumbs down rating.  The bug is heart breaking and a game changer that happens at the very end of the game.  I am not a programer, but this cannot be the toughest bug to fix.  The day this bug is remedied is the day I give this game a thumbs up\\n\\nThis is why I cannot rate this game up.\\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/screenshot/436072840510605697\\n\\nNote: day 39 calls for cool weather.  \"Cool\" weather shows up as predicted on days 40, 41, 42.  The temp goes down a bit during the day time, and I stoke the woodstove.\\n\\nNote: day 42 calls for warm weather, as well as day 45: it drops below freezing on night 44 after nothing but rising temperatures during the day and kills my team.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m going to have to join the minority here and say that I rather disliked the game overall.\\n\\nStorywise, I found it very underwhelming compared to what was advertised.  The game simply does not provide an atmosphere that is conducive for the player to form emotional attachments to the characters - we see very little character development aside from a handful of short text blurbs.  In-game interactions are fairly basic - they feel hungry when not fed, get sick when they are cold, feel tired when they do not sleep, and become depressed when they commit murder (oddly, as far as I remember, characters do not have a similar reaction when stealing from innocents).  After the novelty of the game wears off, these interactions tend to feel sterile, reptitive, and predictable.\\nIn essence, the player never really gets to know the characters, and as a result there is nowhere for the advertised empathy to take root.  I still feel like I\\'m playing a video game, rather than interacting with a game universe - ie, I would not feel bad when I have Boris murder a handful of people in cold blood for their loot, because those \"people\" are faceless NPCs who do not have moral value.  Boris will feel depressed afterwards, but \"depression\" is something that can be cured with a couple clicks and some time, and he\\'ll be right back to the status quo within a night or two and ready to kill faceless NPCs again.  And this cycle repeats endlessly until the end of the war, with the only long-term consequence being a different blurb of text at the end of the game (characters get better or worse epilogues depending on whether you have them spend time being nice to people or murdering them).\\nOccasionally, the game will attempt to give an NPC a face (many of the non-faceless NPCs are already dead by the time you arrive on the scene), but the interactions in the game are always too short and non-interactive to provide much of an impact.  Why should I care about the life of that person in the semi-abandoned house?  She\\'s shooting at me, video game logic dictates that I kill her.  That is the sum of her character, and that does not change simply because another NPC runs over and starts crying over her corpse.  Am I supposed to care simply because I see an animation that resembles someone feeling sad?  As far as I remember, she isn\\'t even given a name, ingame (she is named on the wiki, though).  Both she and the helpless civilian mourning her death lack the complexity needed to provoke a thoughtful or sympathetic reaction from the player.  They don\\'t feel like they\\'re actual people, especially after you\\'ve seen the exact same scene multiple times.\\n\\nI also find that the emotional impact gets buried under the slow and reptitive gameplay.  I found that, at first, I was too busy trying to learn the game and survive to care much about the NPCs I encountered (\"oh, there\\'s a man caring for his elderly parents... hey, look, duct tape!  Exactly what I needed to progress through the game!\").  By the time I learned the game, it felt routine enough that stealing from and killing the NPCs was simply part of a game (\"What, you\\'re caring for your elderly parents?  Meh, seen it 27 times.  Hand over the carrots.\").\\nSimilarly, as I got more familiar with the game, the limited AI in the game made many of the NPCs less believable.  Logically, if I walk into the military base with an assault rifle, a hatchet, and heavy body armor and blow/chop the heads off half the soldiers stationed at the facility (not hard to do once you\\'ve learned the levels and the combat mechanics), and then retreat into the night before the timer reaches daylight, the remaining soldiers SHOULD have some sort of reaction by the time I return the next night.  But no, they don\\'t even alter their patrols.  They keep walking in the same patterns as they always did, completely ignoring the murder of their comrades and the gaping hole in their front gate\\'s defenses.\\n\\nI also find it rather unsatisfying how little we\\'re told about the war itself.  We know that there\\'s a war, and it\\'s bad for the civilians (like any war), and this is somehow supposed to be enough.  It isn\\'t enough, because it doesn\\'t feel believable and it\\'s not an engaging story.  Why is this war being fought?  Who is fighting it, and what do they stand for?  The game rarely gives the player relevant information about what\\'s going on, even when doing so would greatly help the immersion of the game (for instance, if you visit the rebel-occupied school, why don\\'t the rebels take the opportunity to give you some propaganda pamphlets to read?  Why doesn\\'t the government try to drum up patriotism if you visit the military base?).  \\nAre these rebels revolutionary freedom fighters overthrowing an oppressive government, or are they reactionary terrorists?  The message of the game seems to be that it does not matter, and we should focus on the plight of noncombatants because feelings.  Such a sentiment can only preserve the status quo (as wars happen because of attempts to disrupt the status quo), which may well do more long-term harm to the civilians than the war - we don\\'t know, because we aren\\'t told what the status quo is or why the war is being fought.  Maybe the pre-war government was democratic and defend human rights, or maybe it was tyrannical and oppressive.  Maybe the rebels are really trying to help the people, or maybe they\\'re bloodthirsty thugs trying to instill fear.  Maybe neither side is so clear-cut.  Instead of developing this interesting storyline, the game chooses to focus on meaningless appeals to emotion which usually don\\'t stir up the intended emotion and over-dramatic short stories that usually come across as pieces of a story rather than a finished story.  For example, why should we care whether Katia publishes her journal or burns it?  We never knew her in the first place.  We don\\'t even know most of what\\'s going into the journal.  \"She\" was never anything more than a photograph and a few sentences of text, and these were not enough to create an emotional connection between her and the player.\\nIt is almost as if the entire point of the game was to anviliciously try to portray war as fundamentally pointless and gruesome and assert that the only meaningful things are the lives that are damaged by it, but the game fails in demonstrating these because the pointlessness is only brought about by mediocre storytelling and the gruesomeness isn\\'t adequately conveyed in-game, and nor do the lives feel meaningful.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s an ok game, in terms of gameplay, but gets old fairly quickly.  The days in particular often have periods in which you are not doing anything but waiting for something to happen or be built - this is especially the case if you\\'re new to the game and don\\'t have a specific plan laid out in advance with regards to what you need to do and what you need to do it.  Gathering enough resources, particularly food, is difficult at first (especially if you want to survive without stealing), but it gets easier over time. and scavenging quickly starts to feel dull and reptitive.  It\\'s also not particularly difficult once you get rolling - if you\\'re efficient about your looting and resource management, you\\'ll probably have enough resources to go around for most of the game.  Combat is difficult at first, but becomes much easier once you learn the mechanics and even easier once you loot some high-quality gear (the key is to have someone good in melee combat use a hiding place and stab someone in the back with a knife or hatchet as they\\'re walking by.  If they have allies, they\\'ll sprint towards the scene, but you can usually step right back into the hiding place and do the exact same thing with them too.  The NPCs are stupid enough that these kinds of tactics can be used to clear out entire areas, with the only real danger coming from situations in which you\\'re either caught unprepared or have to fight multiple NPCs at once.).',\n",

       "  'review': \"Great game, but I can't commit the amount of time to such a peradeath game.  To me, this game is in the same catagory as Civ 5, I can't play that game anymore because I get too engrossed into it and it takes too long to get a great game going and I easily loose track of time till 2AM, then I have to be at work the next morning.  FTL and Papers, please do it right, the games are short and sweet, to the point and very enjoyable.  Day Z does peradeath right too, it doesn't take too long to get back into the game along side your friends once you die.  When I die or something terrible happens in this game I get so pissed off because I spent four to six hours setting up a fantastic game and immensely enjoying it only to loose it ALL, with the only option to spend another four to six hours getting back to where I was before.  This game is fantastic for a teenager who has the whole summer to spend doing nothing, with no responsibilies and no where to go.  For everyone else, i would say just stay away it'll suck up tremendous amounts of time and you won't realize it untill it's 1AM.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Great theme doesn't save this game.\\n\\nThematically this game works really well and I feel that this has led people to ignore that as a game it in fact fails in most areas. It goes without saying the theme to this game is 10/10. It really achieves what it set out and that theme does a lot to bring a tension to this game.\\n\\nYet the controls are awful, combat is a mess and the poorly executed roguelike elements renders this game an exercise in frustration. \\n\\nWith Characters being one shot killed at times, controlling things through sketchy clicking and relying on autopathing is just skirting with disaster all the time. Imagine playing any stealth game with just a mouse and you will get the idea. It often feels like a quick reflex game with no way to actually use your reflexs because the controls are just terrible. Point and click stealth action in a permadeath environment is awful. \\n\\nCombat is just as bad, melee is click on enemy and watch your character swing hoping you kill them before they kill you. Stealth kills are I guess okay just the same click with a different icon. Ranged weapons are a disaster, attempt to get behind cover in the most finicky clicking possible and then shoot by clicking. The whole time you will wish you were able to do this with a keyboard. \\n\\nAvoiding the stealth and combat is quite difficult. Crafting barely turns a profit from raw materials (You can just barely buy back the raw goods from selling the end product) and relies on you scavenging the materials. This leads to the economy of the game being pretty unrealistic and in many ways removes the peaceful option (though it is mostly possible it becomes vastly more effort than other strategies). In what world is a bottle of moonshine about as valuable than the water and sugar it took to make, especially during a severe war. Rolled cigarettes are about as valuable as raw tobacco. \\n\\nThe economy of this game is entirely unrealistic due to being made arbitarily difficult. Buying guns and ammo is not difficult mid game but want a hatchet though and you are often completely out of luck. A shovel for sale is rarer than a gun in this game. A metal workshop is easier to make than a vegetable garden. Rolling a cigarette is more difficult than making a radio. At the start building a bed is fine but boarding up a window take upgrades. Also bandages take pure alcohol to make...  In short the theme and immersion of this game is thrown out the window and replaced with nonsensical rules to create a difficulty that feels incredibly artificial. It's a disaster.\\n\\nThere is very little roguelike execution. Levels are the same with some having NPC variation. Now unless you are using a guide you will be seeing those areas again and again so the pain of losing is enormous. Also the places that appear each game change the difficulty dramatically, which is a poor execution. \\n\\nThis game is actually bad. One great feature doesn't make up for terrible mechanics and controls. There are aspects of this game that are well executed but as a whole package it falls completely flat.\",\n",

In fact, I enjoy this game more than most of the games in my steam library. \\n\\nHowever, I can't recommend This War of Mine because the combat is absolutely genuinely terrible. It's clunky, ugly, and there is seemingly no skill involved. I've attempted to play this game through on multiple occasions but I just continue to get people killed because they don't know how to fight. It never fails that I get mad, delete my save, then start a new one some couple days later after I forget how poorly done the combat is. \\n\\nI really wish I could enjoy this game more but the combat just makes it impossible.\",\n",

[/i]\\n\\nI\\'m as anti-war as the next guy ( maybe even more so ), but this game is absolute garbage. I\\'m glad it was a gift, and nothing I wasted my own money on. \\n\\nThe graphics - while I understand that they are an artistic choice - render the game ugly and nearly unplayable. Good thing for those icons, or I wouldn\\'t be able to tell a searchable pile from a ladder, or a pile of debris I have to shovel through. \\n\\nThe game\\'s mechanics are nothing more than long days of crafting interrupted by forced breaks, during which you either go out and scavenge ( only at night? ) or choose to stay home and... skip the whole night. \\n\\nTime - Why must I skip doing anything at all, at night . . . simply because I didn\\'t need to go out and scavenge? No reason given. Also, why can\\'t I speed up time? Skipping the rest of the \"day\" makes me miss out on traders and the like. Poorly executed, devs. Tsk, tsk.\\n\\nThe controls are horrid - point and click, exclusively - we really couldn\\'t have the ability to use a controller, or move via traditional WASD? This could have been much better if your character was controlled in a \"twin-stick\" type of manner, using one for movement and the other for interaction.\\n\\nIf you do find yourself enjoying a run, don\\'t be surprised when your gameplay is halted by an imposed ending. Give us a sandbox mode, maybe, before offering DLC that adds nothing to the game?\\n\\nOn the subject of DLC . . . don\\'t get me started on the pseudo-dlc they offer; charity is great, but paying for some scribbles that add no value to the game . . . really? The devs are so enamored of their own creation - or they really do think we\\'re all suckers - that EA ought to employ them, they figured out how to get people to pay for refrigerator-worthy drawings.\\n\\nThis game certainly has its fanboys and supporters, and I wanted to be one of them, but it\\'s junk. Buy this on sale - if you must - but don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.',\n",

It has very few mechanics, none of them interesting or well implemented.\\n- FRUSTRATED. This game is frustrating. Like war? I don\\'t know and, frankly, I do not care since I\\'m not in war right now and I just want to enjoy a game. Every mechanic is designed to frustrate you, penalize you, make you angry. I\\'m not talking about the difficulty, I\\'m talking about gratuitous punishment of the player and RANDOM events that DESTROY everything you built with strategy, reflexes, recources administration. You spend half an hour crafting boards, managing food, making difficult trades, scavenging like a thief, hiding, fighting for your life and then... YOU HAVE BEEN ROBBERED DURING THE NIGHT. They took all your food, medicines, parts. They wounded your party, they stole something. \"BUT I PUT 3 PEOPLES ON GUARD WITH 3 ASSAULT RIFLES, 2 PISTOLS, 4 KNIVES, 3 AXEX, 2 SHOTGUNS, 132 BULLETS\". The game doesen\\'t care. You\\'ve been robbered. (I feel robbered of my money for this frustrating piece of S***!!).\\n- NOT SAD! Seriously guys. Are you really sad because you have to stole food from a couple of old guys? I mean c\\'mon! The game BLOCKS 75% of the locations for 10 days or so and FORCE YOU to robber poor people in order to survive. This is so stupid that I wanted to kill the elder couple just to fight the boring schematics the devs imposed me. War is terrible, we all know. But ZERO INTERACTION with people, forced bad actions and stuff like that are really supposed to make me SAD? geez....\\n- Eager to play a damn FPS to actually feel some satisfaction.\\n\\nOk now reading all the positive \"OH MY GOD THE WAR IS TERRIBLE THIS GAME MADE ME DO SOME TERRIBLE THINGS! II\\'M CRYING FOR ALL THE EVIL IN THIS FILTHY WORLD!\" reviews you\\'re thinking that I\\'m some kind of ignorant and stupid kid. Think what you want but make yourself a favor, do not buy this game. It\\'s simply NOT FUN.\\nNow back to business, wearing the glasses that my granpa wore during second world war, in russia, hidden in a hole, freezing to death, praying for his life while a tank was passing over his head.',\n",

It's a decent game, but please keep in mind that this survial type game is based on keeping your group of 3 alive from starvation, depression, and those type of things. Kind of like Oregon Trail! Except, you're in a building instead of a wagon and people love to rob you when you leave it. You have a little bit of time during the day to build supplies, eat, sleep, and what not. At night, one person goes out and scavanges for things you might need. They didn't really guide you much at the beginning of the game, and I found myself going to this places only to not be able to get much because of the other people there who would kill me if I touched their stuff. Except for the old couple's house.... I took all the things! And then the woman in my group hanged herself because she couldn't live with the guilt. Man up!

       "  'review': 'Generaly speaking , people consider Starcraft the most exhausting game. Personly i can play Starcraft for 2-3 hours , then i need to have a rest. This game is a monster compeared to SC. Keeping alive 3-4 guys for a week requires so much planning , focus and luck that is more than a  I can handle. I even read all the tutorials on the internet , i wrote down a complete build order just to finally keep my guys alive for 45 days . I really tried to do so , because i liked this game, and the fact that finally a game is not about shooting brailessly .End in the end I asked the question from myself : Worth it? My answer was NO. This game is just too fckn miserable and exhausting  to be enjoyed . If you dont have a bounch of freetime , patience and energy just avoid this game because you wont enjoy it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This War of Mine is a pretty immersive, easy, understandable game. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t have much of a replay value in its current state. During the game, you try and survive the horrors of war with 3-4 people in a building that can barely be called home. Food, water, gas, weapons, and supplies are all on a shortage which give you one of three options: kill, steal, trade. Between a month-month and a half, the international forces arrive and put an end to the civil war - you just have to decide what it takes to reach a new age of peace. \\n\\nWith all that in mind, playing through the game twice is enough forever (you can theorectically get all achievements within one playthrough aswell). The \"create your own story\" or whatever its called has severe limitations to creativity (there\\'s limited traits, can\\'t select how much someone can carry, can\\'t determine their addcitions, etc.), which completely undermines the entire idea of your own story. Without mod support or the ability to play around with map creation, the game gets stale rather quickly.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is much overrated.\\n\\nWhile most critics and player comments describe this game as \"story rich\" \"emotional experience\" - NO. Even some flash games of the same genre did better on this. The developer clearly get it wrong, you don\\'t build emotional linkages without a few storys or two. You don\\'t get into people\\'s heart by just reading lines of \"I was once a man with a simple life\". Two little boys knocking on your door asking for medicine? Couldn\\'t care less about that. Not because I am heartless, but it failed to control how stories unfold under randomly generated game worlds. Some did **much better** on this.\\n\\nThis game relys heavily on resources management and optimial decision making, rather than what it is to be a powerless civilian. **Hard to move on =/= tough decisions**, it just leave us with no choice. If we don\\'t have any hard feeling about that, it would be just boring point-and-click, watch that little guys slowly drained down a spiral of depression, start cursing under frustration without any connection to the story. When it\\'s over, I wouldn\\'t bother to start another new game.\\n\\nThe most overrated indie game of 2014, may I repeat. Google \"Rebuild\", it\\'s a flash game with the same concept, released much earlier and did much better in terms of that \"story\" and \"atmosphere\" This War of Mine tried hard but failed.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game was at the top of my wishlist since it came out. Due to various backlogs, I decided not to buy at launch and instead wait for a sale. The 60% off a few days ago did it for me. \\n\\nSadly, I must say, I am pretty disappointed having now played the game. There is absolutely no overreaching narrative. Whatever threadbare narrative the game has, is repetitive (character dialogues for example) or predictable (the letters/notes you occasionally find). \\n\\nThis game is all about the gameplay, and on a personal level, I am not fond of such mechanics. Collect/loot stuff to craft items/weapons/equipments etc. Micromanaging. I wouldn\\'t have mind if this was a vessel to a great narrative, but it is not...it is the focal point of the game. \\n\\nAgain, I repeat, I am not fond of such mechanics, hence why I am disappointed in the game. It\\'s not a game for everybody, that\\'s for sure (but if that\\'s the case, I\\'m surprised with the 96% rating). \\n\\nIf there\\'s one thing the game does exceptionally well, is that it makes you feel depressed while playing it. No kidding. Everything moves at a slow pace. Sometimes you just can\\'t do anything cause your characters are broken/depressed/tired. It\\'s also quite unforgiving, and is a game meant to be replayed many times before you can \"win\", but having already played twice into the 20-days region, I cannot imagine playing again..just seems too repetitive if I do that. \\n\\nI\\'ll not recommend it based on my personal experience and expectations, but the game is well-made enough that if you like such gameplay and don\\'t care about narratives/story, then you should get it.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought this due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews but failed to see the appeal. My main criticism is that the game is very slow paced and a far too unforgiving. Its highly repetitive after the first few days, and despite my every effort, all of my housemates were constantly sick for no obvious reason, and all starved within about 15 turns. Once I got about this far in the game, raids became so frequent (despite reinforcing my house twice and having someone on guard every night) that my characters' deaths became inevitable and I was able to see inevitability this many turns in advance.\\n\\nI wouldnt be so bad if you could scavange more than one place a night or dispatch more than one person to scavenge (like you could in reality). Multiple times I would arrive to scavenge an area, and either not have the tools I needed to get through a door or immediately meet an adversary with a gun. In these scenarios I was forced to turn back immediately, thereby wasting my night of scavenging and making everyone in my house hungrier. This was ultimately my downfall, because it left me with not even supplies I needed to barter with for food once I returned without food virtually every day. Food is also very costly to trade for and rare in general. \\n\\nI understand that you're supposed to feel the stress of the scenario, but I didnt even get to survive long enough to unlock all of the equipment you could build or explore half of the areas available. This was all despite my most diligent attempts to succeed from the beginning. If the games are randomly generated, berhaps I met with a very dificult one on my first play through, but I had no way of knowing this in advance that I knew of. The whole experience was mostly tedious, bland and unfulfilling.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Pretty well made game, game mechanics work well for the most part. Art work is strong and noticeable, using a pencil sketching style, but the reason for not recommending this game is because I simply didn\\'t enjoy it. I don\\'t care for survival games too much, but tried this out at the recommendation of a friend. Despite not caring much for the genre I trucked through and did complete a single \"story\" and survived until day 23 :)\\n\\nThis War of Mine is played as a small group of survivors living in a large house. Each night 1 survivor may leave to search for goods while the others stay and sleep or guard the house. Your house has many utilities you can build- a small garden, a heater, rat trap for food, a stove, etc. You use these utilities and workstations to craft goods you\\'ll need to survive. While you can eat raw food, cooked food does much better for filling you up. You\\'ll need to board up your house where, I would assume, collateral damage from the war has created large gaps in the walls and windows. Both your day cycle to build items, harvest goods, and interact with other survivors, traders, etc, and your night cycle to find new goods, are timed with a clock in the top left corner.\\n\\nYour survivors each have a different skill set. I got Bruno, Pavle, and Katia as my starting three. Bruno is a good cook who can create food using fewer resources. Pavle runs fast so he can avoid danger or run from it while scavenging. Katia is a good bargainer so she can squeeze more out of your trade deals. Later on I got Cveta and Arika with \"Good with children\" and \"Sneaks quietly\" skills, respectively. I saw in the build your own game section there are quite a few survivors, all with their different skill sets.\\n\\nThe scavenging is done only during the night and if you don\\'t manage to exit voluntarily before the night ends, then your character gets \"caught out\" and will have a delay before he and his scavenged goods return. To scavenge you first pick who will go, then where. The where is very important as each area has certain resources- building materials, weapons parts, food, traders, and even danger! (Gasp!) Revisiting some areas will show development of the region with new people taking over or previously present people disappearing. Scavenging is as simple as clicking on highlighted rubble, desks, drawers, cabinets, etc, and after a moment to inspect the spot, you get an inventory screen showing what you have and what you can take.\\n\\nWar is hell. I knew this well before playing this game and I\\'m strongly against coercive force and am a supporter of the non-aggression principle. I like to role play and empathize with the characters I\\'m playing as, whether it\\'s Mass Effect, Deponia, or Civilization 5. I made the decision early on I would help anyone I could and wouldn\\'t harm another person. I knew somewhere in the \"teens\" days I wouldn\\'t make it far and I was ok with it. Trading couldn\\'t get me enough food or bandages, bandits hit the home every single night, and I couldn\\'t scavenge everything needed. I stole from armed bandits a few times, very carefully, and thanked the Lord for Pavle\\'s large inventory space and his fast running. In the end, we just didn\\'t make it.\\n\\nIf you\\'re into survival games, and the life and death aspects of it, then pick this up. It has an amazing human element to it and I think was extremely realistic in how it handled the precious few resources available and the decisions on how to use them. All in all, bottom line is I would not freely recommend this game to a friend. It has a niche audience and isn\\'t fun. It\\'s challenging and engaging, but this means it\\'s not for everyone.',\n",

I have played it now twice for a combined total of 3 hours, in 2017 and now in 2020 after they've updated it. It was and is a very boring survivalist management simulator. There's no emotion, just your characters bumbling around the screen, there's no way to communicate with o NPCs, and after having played the game for two hour sI felt no better equipped to go scavenging or take care of my home than I did in the 10 minutes, so there was no sense of progress. It's very unclear the level of danger your characters are in until they are dead, so its hard to effectively manage the risks for them. I also felt that 3 characters in the house was either not enough or too many, either have so few characters the player is forced to make hard choices (2 or less), OR have 4 or more players so you can kick butt when you go scavenging. 3 players leads to the clear optimization of one person on guard duty, one person sleeping and one person scavenging. \\n\\n Only perk I would say is that it runs as a 64 bit executable on Intel Graphics on a Mac OS, which is a rare breed these days.

       " 'I am giving this a thumb down rating, but it is a very qualified \"thumb down\" because the game is original and interesting. HOWEVER...\\n\\nThis War of Mine is a time-eater. The game requires you to invest a lot of time with only minimal payoffs. The game requires you to spend hours just plodding along.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s sort of the point (the game\\'s purpose is to replicate the feeling of being stuck in a wartime scenario). You\\'re a civilian trying to get by while the city is on lock-down and resources are dwindling. (When you go out to get stuff, you\\'re \"scavenging,\" but outsiders are \"invaders\" or \"looters.\")\\n\\nGame play alternates between day and night activities. Daytime in your shelter consists primarily of Resource Management skills: using meager supplies in the most advantageous ways. You\\'ll assess what\\'s available, how much you need, and how best to use it to build things like rat traps, water filters, beds, shelter reinforcements, medications, and so on. It\\'s reminiscent of The Sims in that you have to take care of little people who walk around, get hungry, have health woes, and even emotional issues. \\n\\nAt night, the game is a little like Thief (in 2-D) -- you sneak out to various locations and try to get more stuff. One of the game\\'s big problems is that you are harshly punished if you don\\'t figure out the interface in time. You will spend literally hours trying to accumulate stuff and stay alive, but if you click the wrong button on accident you lose all your progress, and the game won\\'t let you rewind: If your character dies, that\\'s it, he/she is dead. There\\'s no save to go back to. \\n\\nYes, \"That\\'s the way things are in war\"  -- a combination of tedium and danger. Fine. But it stinks to play a game for 5 hours and then abruptly die because when you clicked \"Run to Exit,\" the game made you go to an exit on THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN that you didn\\'t know was there (and hadn\\'t unlocked yet). That doesn\\'t teach you about war -- that\\'s clunky programming. This kind of unforgiving game-play is dumb and extremely frustrating.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the shelter portion of the game, there are game interface flaws that degrade the experience. For example, you can build an item and you can also chop that same item up to get firewood (for when it is deathly cold in the winter). One such item is the indoor garden -- which requires loads of precious resources to create. \\n\\nWhen you\\'re using the garden, there is a single icon, but when it\\'s finished (when your character has planted carrots or something), the single icon moves over and there are two icons, side-by-side, with one being the icon to chop up the whole gardening station and use it for firewood. Simply because of a program interface flaw, you might accidentally destroy your garden without meaning to! And guess what? There is no stopgap such as \"Are you sure?\" This would have been entirely programmable, if the creators had the foresight to realize the flaw of their interface.\\n\\nThe game is intriguing nonetheless. There are occasionally moral decisions to make -- usually a question of whether to steal from others. If you do, then your characters become depressed. You can let them play guitar or smoke cigarettes to feel better. Needless to say this is all a little shallow for a game attempting to replicate the horrors of wartime.\\n\\nI played the whole thing through just to finally get to the end of the war. It is anti-climactic: the game abruptly ends and you see some scrolling images summarizing a few of the things that happened while you played. The real reward was having a good excuse to stop playing. I did find the experience different and involving for a while, though.',\n",

I don\\'t know, and I\\'m not going to look for it, since it is quite crucial for the survival of your characters, given that if they \"miss\", the person that you\\'re trying to shank will swiftly give your character a proper good smack and yeet a quarter of their health away, and the game should at least explain how hit chance is calculated. \\n\\nAnother issue is with the way guarding works. Or rather, how it doesn\\'t work. \\nWhat increases the chances of the person I left on guard duty not getting shanked? What decreases the chance of things being stolen?

That would imply that there were two bandits at most, and they managed to take off with all of my food, something that the person on guard duty should attempt to protect at all costs. If they would\\'ve gotten injured during that encounter, that would\\'ve been fine, but the way I imagine it going down is the thieves rummaging through the fridge while the guard is standing in the other room yelling at them. It makes sense for the thieves to steal valuables while the guard has just been injured and is trying to deal with their wounds. It also makes sense for the guard to be distracted by at least two thieves, while at least one other is yoinking what he can.

       " 'First thing:  I do recommend this game, with caveats.   But, given only a thumbs up or thumbs down review, I thought I should try to be objective.  I think you should know what you are getting into before purchasing this game - it could be thought of as \"The Sims - Misery DLC.\"\\n\\nThe graphics are beautiful in the representation of miserable surroundings.  The characters are given enough personality for you to feel for their situation.  The game mechanics flow well.\\n\\nCharacters have bios and specific things they like.   A character may be a cigarette smoker and if you find cigarettes this may provide them a small respite from despair.  But, not too much.\\n\\nYou start out with three players in your hideout.  You can give them commands, such as scavenging, building objects, eating, healing or sleeping.  The days go by fast, make sure to get enough sleep.  Your players will quickly be on the verge of collapse.\\n\\nWar is hell.   This is a simulation of their day to day fight to stay alive when staying alive is all that matters.  The game play is in two parts - day and night.  \\n\\nDuring the day you can build crude devices in your hideout to keep your players alive, such as a stove, heater, beds, weapons.  It looks like the standard building mechanics - you need enough of supply A to build part B to use in tool C.  If you don\\'t have water, combustibles, a stove and food, you can\\'t make soup.  A trader will usually come to the door and you can barter for things you need.  Be prepared to give away a lot to get very little in return.  I have not seen any leveling up, just a slow sad spiral into hunger, depression, exhaustion, sickness and injury until they are broken.  You can heal your players but it never lasts very long.  You never have enough supplies, your players will always be hungry, hurt, depressed and sick. \\n\\nAt night, one of your players can go to other sites on the map and scavenge for food and supplies to keep yourself alive.  You control the scavenger while the others remain behind at your hideout.  Scavenging is a bit of stealth and can be a moral dilemma.  Will you rob the old couple in their house, or leave them alone?  Will you ignore the old man\\'s pleas to leave his wife medicine, or steal it to heal your injured comrade?  Can you avoid the other occupants of other hideouts, or will you beat them to death and risk getting shot.  These decisions weigh on the conscience of the scavenger when s/he returns.   \\n\\nWhen you return from scavenging, you are updated on what happened while you were out scavenging.  It may be a calm night, or raiders may have come and stolen supplies and injured your players that stayed behind to stand guard.  Your players that remained behind may have abandoned your hideout and do not come back.  If one of your players was sick or injured, they might have died.  If a player was depressed, they may have committed suicide.\\n\\nI think the goal of the game is to survive until the armistice or ceasefire.  I haven\\'t made it that far yet.   Maybe you can reach a point where you have enough food, supplies and weapons that you can barricade yourself in and ride it out.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\nAt the end of the game, you are given a recap of every significant action taken in the game, such as players dying, robbing or killing others.  During one of my games, two players abandoned my hideout while the third died from his injuries.  On the final screen of the game, I found out that the two players that left the hideout were shot and died.  One was shot while trying to cross the border to get to his family, the other was shot when a trade deal went bad.\\n\\nThis is what you are getting into.  I would recommend this game to someone who understands what Cormac Mccarthy\\'s \"The Road\" is.  Think of a Solzhenitsyn video game.   I would not call it \"fun\" game play and you will not be laughing while you play it.  I do not think this would be a good party game.  It\\'s a misery simulator that can be addicting to play, just to see if can get them to survive another day, or figure out the game play to make the struggle easier.  The game itself masterpiece but I don\\'t know if I would want to play this over and over again just because it such a melancholy game and the struggle seems too real.\\n\\nSo recommend it, sure.  But this is not The Sims or a fantasy RPG where you keep getting more powerful and magical healers cast spells to heal their crew or an FPS that lets you upgrade weapons to keep destroying all the demons the game can throw at you.   There is no conjuring or superpowers.  This War of Mine is gritty, depressing and probably not for everyone.  \\n\\nMaybe everyone should play it.  The other side of this is that it all seems too real and this is not fantasy.  It has happened to humanity before, it is happening now and it will keep happening.  This is your chance to experience misery and hell on earth from the comfort of a computer game.',\n",

There is a bit of sneaking which is always Quite fun, otherwise the mine problem is \\n\\n1. There is very limited amount of locations you can go to (so you know exactly what to expect once uve been there)\\n2. Due to huge amount of materials in each location, you have to return there sometimes up to 5-6 times to get all you might need to further improve your base\\n\\nThis could be easily solved by either putting up more locations with less materials, or allowing you to return to a place in the same night more than once if you reach it within a time limit (sometimes you ltierally walk in, pick first pile you see and you can go back - certainly didnt take me whole night, did it?)\\n\\nAtmosphere is Quite nice as well as graphics, certainly shows that in war that there arent just soldiers and heroes, but many, many ordinary people - all generations, with all kinds of skills and stories.\\n\\nRegarding the season pass, stories -\\n\\nFirst story is completely crap. Now why is that? Because you are forced into a role of father saving his daughter, no choices to be made - you simply have to save your daughter, this is bad because it does not work with the game design, if I want to submerge myself into story I probably dont wanna spend whole day building a herbal garden or distilling alcohol while my poor kid is somewhere out there raped by bandits. Also there is some dirty homeless guy sayin he tells me where she is only if I bring him food. You know what any sane parent including me would do? Take that crowbar I had in hand and beat him until he tells me. First story - unplayable.\\n\\nSecond is interesting and gives you a lot of choices, I wont really spoil, but this time you wont be listening to radio. It is also nice addition that the guy has broken legs so you are very limited in what to do.\\n\\nThird was certainly my favorite and this is where the game shined for me, I work as an antique dealer so saving art really touched me. It was Quite challenging as you are playing in cold winter, you need constant lumber to keep the fire going - but its hard to come by, and even more - you can destroy the art to make wood, tough decision, be cold or save the art....\\nI of course refused to burn any art, later when I got to museum I saved all the stuff, milena was captured and released...soI wated for her to return. I was running low on food and everyone was sick, it kept getting worse, had to barter EVERYTHING to the last gear I had for medicine and vegetables....milena wasnt commin, no she wasnt. I tought I could escape along with art with the kids so I gave them the jewish items, but it seemed I still coudlnt escape. Siding with the guy who has a vault seemed like a poor decision - I wanna get the art out of the city, not keep it there, even tho somewhat safe.... So the colonel it was, sacrificed the most important piece to get us out. Fool me, milena returned, colonel killed her and stole all stuff...but alas, at least we saved lifes. Makes one wonder if legacy is indeed more important than life. Surely touched me.\\n\\nOverall: Worth at sale. Not worth the full price. Very repetitive, time consuming and stale.

In a real world if you shot and killed people who attacked you in a warzone, youd loot their corpses for weapons, armor and ammo. In this game? All you do is lose resources to raids, this was fine until they tweaked the settings so that its basically a 50/50 chance of getting raided every night right from day 1 even outside of a crime wave\\n\\n2: Random map locations, you can get literally screwed over so hard by getting locations that you're forced to either steal from people and get massive mood penalties or super hard combat locations like construction site, hotel, etc right on day 1 as your only choices to work off of. Either you lose in the first week from depression or people are killed by the combat with no weapons. You can say to tiptoe or do cautious looting, except that this is PURELY rng dependant on what you start with, and you can frequently get so screwed at the start you have to just exit and restart the scenario for better locations. Thats a problem where im sitting\\n\\n3: Theft triggers. Even after all these years there are countless locations like the notorious Hotel that STILL proc negative theft penalties when your killing people that even ingame on that map is saying are lunatics (the mutilated bodies in hotel for instance that says theyre psychos), yet you loot the place after euthanizing their blight? Enjoy depression in your house, good times. That bug has been around since the very get go, still around.\\n\\n\\nLook, I can cheese a game, i can strategize like most of the best and find a way to make it work, but thats not what my review right now is about. Its about how the game is more painful to play then it used to be, it doesn't force hard decisions on you for the sake of morals now, but rather forces you to get screwed by overly tuned mechanics that tie you into the same cookie cutter play style EVERY map now\\n\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ll go against the grain here and won\\'t recommend this game. Reading other reviews, a lot of people liked this game because it is allegedly so gritty, realistic and unusual. But it just isn\\'t a good game, in my opinion. \\n\\n\\n[h1]First, the story.[/h1] \\n\\nThere isn\\'t one besides that you are stuck in a city ravaged by a civil war and it sucks. Instead, the game just constantly hammers its message home: war is bad and innocent people get hurt. Who knew? It\\'s not even subtle. In the hospital, you find a note that the pediatric wing was hit the hardest in a shelling and most kids died. In the supermarket, a soldier is sexually assaulting a woman and there\\'s nothing you can do about it. Kids are begging for meds for their mother. That kind of thing. And in case you somehow miss all that, there\\'re a few F... the war graffiti around. But luckily, the greatest problem your guys have is that they\\'re out of coffee or cigarettes.\\n\\n\\n[h1]But more importantly, the gameplay is not very good, either.[/h1] \\n\\nOver day you\\'re stuck in a house where you can do some crafting and your guys can eat and sleep. Occasionally, a trader or people looking for help come around. At night, one of you goes out scavenging. \\nThe days are absolutely tedious. Every day, you have to scan the radio, make firewood, cook food, make water, tell your guys to eat and sleep, and take care of your other crafting. It\\'s completely repetitive. And you have to do all that by point & click if you play with mouse and keyboard (don\\'t know how it works with controller). There isn\\'t even the option to speed time up, you have to wait until they veeerry slooowly finish what they are crafting before you can send them to the next task. \\nThe nights aren\\'t much better. Try to sneak through the different locations, grab all the stuff, go home when your backpack is full. In some locations, you can trade but you have to bring whatever you plan to trade and since neither \"prices\" are fixed nor the trader\\'s inventory, it\\'s almost impossible to predict what you\\'ll need.\\nCombat is basically spamming your mouse button and hope for the best.\\nThere\\'s no RPG element whatsoever, so you don\\'t get better at combat, sneaking or trading, you can\\'t even craft a bigger backpack - there\\'s no change, no progression, it all stays the same.\\n\\nAll in all, I was pretty disappointed. I like base-building games. I like strategy games. I like stealth games. In theory, this game is right up my alley. But the only strategy involved here is the sequence in which you build/upgrade additional crafting benches and finding enough supplies to do that takes several days of scavenging. There\\'s a couple of options to generate food but they are pretty useless and take a lot of supplies, a lot of time, or both. The stealth part isn\\'t that great, either. If anyone is moving close by, you wait until they went elsewhere or take a different route. Basically, everything in this game is tedious and takes too long and there\\'s absolutely nothing that makes up for it. \\n\\nSo, I recommend this game for people who like being bored and depressed. The rest should maybe give Sheltered or Mark of the Ninja (if you like stealth) a try instead.',\n",

You have three guys, only one can scavenge, the other two can sleep or gaurd. If you don\\'t gaurd you will get supplies stolen every 3 nights on average and if you only send one to gaurd with no weapons he will get injured. If you don\\'t sleep for two days, they will get tired and eventually unable to do anything BUT sleep.

       " 'It\\'s a decent game, but it has significant problems. The setting is interesting, focusing on the survival of ordinary civilians during a city under siege, inspired by real life Sarajevo, if I understand it correctly. The game is kinda bleak, but I didn\\'t really find it depressing, it\\'s rather you managing to make a cozy little shelter in a rough place, at least once you\\'ve figured out the mechanics. My favourite feeling was managing the temperature at a decent 16 degrees during the cold wave.\\n\\nThe presentation works well, they sell the bleak setting with simple but pretty graphics. The story of each character is kinda basic and didn\\'t quite grab me, though.\\n\\nThe place where the game falls apart is in the mechanics. The game is a survival game with crafting and rougelite elements: The core gameplay loop is you building stuff during the day, and sending one person to scavenge during the night. You can\\'t reload earlier saves (I mean, I\\'m sure you can do some save file shenanigans, but it\\'s not the intended way to play) and the game randomizes content. You manage the usual survival aspects: mental and physical health, hunger, thirst, sleep, temperature. All good stuff.\\n\\nThere are some merits to the survival mechanics, usually I find that there are way too much focus on managing a huge number of bars, here it feels a bit more relaxed. However, the game falls apart a bit in the execution. I won\\'t spoil the specifics, but there is definitely a best way to play, where you basically can ignore any real randomness and do more or less the same thing each time. This defeats the core principles of a good rougelite, where the challenge is doing the best with the assets you\\'re dealt, and makes the gameplay similar, and offering little reason to replay it. And since the developers obviously intend you to replay it, giving you different starting characters to unlock, it must be seen as a bit of a failure on their part. \\n\\nOther issues is the game length, once your shelter is up and running, there is little incentive to do much more than play it safe and wait out the siege, and so the final part of the game feels tedious, and winning a foregone conclusion, and while I haven\\'t clocked it, I would say that this part streches for easily an hour, maybe more. \\n\\nBut before you\\'ve figured out the optimal strategy the game is a lot more interesting, and unless you look at a faq, it might take a while to find it. So if this game seems interesting to you, feel free to give it a try. I don\\'t regret my purchase at all, so my \"thumbs down\" should be more seen as \"read up on it before you buy\" than \"avoid\".',\n",

So if you were foolish enough like me to put all your wood in the fire place you are fucked to be able to cook any food.

This war of mine is a *very difficult* game, which is always nice but not on this case since the randomness of facts like the loot spawned on the places that you visit, the random chance at night of your survivors being injured or getting sick, the random chance of the trader giving you the items you really need, the random chance of getting new survivors, the random... I think you got the point. Gameplay-wise this game is completely infuriating, more after buying the \"the little ones\" DLC, where you grow more attached to the characters and want to see them live on this unfair, RNG based game.. Leaving the RNG part, the gameplay also is very repetitive, many nights you will need to retry in order to learn the patterns of the NPCs, which will mean that you will also have to repeat the day on which the same keeps happening \"craft, sleep, trade...\", a saving system (which is nonexistent, the game saves automatically once day and that\\'s it) could alleviate this issue. Finally, the combat is very unstable and poorly planted, which means that there\\'s no skill involved, so you\\'ll need to pray to the RNG gods and also retry the night a couple times in order to not get killed\\nI despise this game for reaping so much success off sucking on sensible themes.',\n",

I loved the idea the moment I watched the trailer and I don\\'t think I would change anything about the game itself, as every element is designed to convey an important message about war. Games have a long history of glorifying armed conflicts and there are seemingly infinite titles with the word \"war\" in them, and yet even the ones that try to show war for what it is (essentially a rather awful business) sooner or later boil down to action-packed shootouts where every enemy skull cracked open with with a bullet is a little adrenaline-inducing triumph with little time for moral considerations.\\n\\nThis War of Mine is different. It\\'s a tale about trying to survive in inhumane circumstances while retaining some shreds of humanity. Your enemies here are not minions of a ruthless dictator or followers of a murderous ideology that can be lethally dispatched without breaking the comfort of moral superiority. Your enemies here are mundane and impersonal, slowly and inevitably creeping at the characters under your control: hunger, cold, disease and mental breakdown. You also have to fight other human beings, but it\\'s hard to think of them as enemies, as they\\'re also just trying to survive and protect their friends and loved ones, sometimes even at the cost of compromising their morals. And it becomes harder to judge them for it, as the longer you play this game, the more moral compromises will you be forced to make as well, up to the point of making you wonder if you\\'re still one of the good guys.\\n\\nAnd this is how a video game becomes a powerful medium for an important message. War is not guns and glory. War is a set of circumstance that turns people against each other, making moral principles a liability that puts individuals who follow them at a disadvantage. Over time, only those willing to break them get to live another day and condemn another settlement to freezing and starvation by robbing them of vital supplies.\\n\\nSo, why can\\'t I recommend it? Because, while I find every aspect of the game superbly executed, I also find it too overwhelmingly depressing to play.

       " \"Ok though I liked my time with this game, it suffers from the same fate as so many other games that could have been great. \\n\\nCONCEPT:\\n\\nThis War of Mine is a survival-themed strategy game where the player controls a group of civilian survivors in a makeshift shelter in the besieged, war-torn fictional city of Pogoren, Graznavia. The main goal of the game is to survive the war with the tools and materials the player can gather with the characters they control. Most of the characters under the player's control have no military background or any kind of survival experience, and will require constant intervention by the player in order to stay alive. It is the player's responsibility to maintain their characters' health, hunger and mood levels until the declaration of a ceasefire, which occurs after a randomized duration. (this text taken directly from this games wiki)\\n\\nDuring the daytime, hostile snipers will prevent the survivors from venturing outside, thereby offering the player time to craft tools from gathered materials, trade, upgrade the shelter, cook food and heal the survivors. At night, the player is given the opportunity to venture out and scavenge nearby areas for valuable resources for their everyday survival. During their excursions, the player-controlled survivors can encounter other NPC survivors of the war, who they can choose to help with gifts of food or medicine, or rob and kill. (this text taken directly from this games wiki)\\n\\nThis all sounds impressive and tense, but it really isn't. This game is too easy and predictable. Why?....well I'll tell ya!\\n\\n*Hostile snipers don't really prevent you from going outside as I go outside to help NPC survivers every few day and get back safe.\\n\\n*Night scavenging runs are only dangerous if you venture in areas you have been forwarned are dangerous beforehand! Seriously there is like no randomness that PEACEFUL LUNATIC will attack you, or that behind the church scavenger with a gun will turn on you. If you're not to reckless (and are sneaky) killing armed gunmen with a knife or axe is an EASY, EASY event.\\n\\n*Getting supplies you need, Food, Wood, Parts, Medicine, or Weapons never seems to be a risky or pressing matter like the game leeds you to believe. \\n\\n*Though the learning curve is very harsh in the begining, once you know where to go and what to build first the games an auto win.\\n\\n*The items you MAY really lack can be obtained by a NPC trader that come to YOUR DOOR safely every few days. Where are the snipers then?\\n\\nThis game need randomness, danger and desperation to take it from OK to GREAT and REPLAYABLE.\\n\\nIt needs a chance...like 10% plus 1% added per week that events, or people can go dark and desperate. I'll explain.\\n\\nYou leave the house during the day for NPCS (Above chance) you're wounded or killed by snipers.\\n\\nThe armed scavenger(s) or PEACEFUL LUNATIC(S) (Above chance) try to kill you.\\n\\nThe NPC that come to you're door and join you as PCs (Above chance) are LYING!!! Trying to get into you're house to steal you're food, kill you, or open you're house for night looters. \\n\\n\\nAs is this game is ok at best, buy on 70% off sale like I did. \\n\\nGAME MAKERS...make a THIS GAME IS NO LONGER TOO EASY EDITION or EXPANSION. \\n\\nWhere the game is actually hard. \\n\\nNPC's are desperate and will act eractically.\\n\\nSnipers might shoot you during the day. \\n\\n***You're at least on the right path....just needs alot of work.***\\n\\n\\nNIGHTHATER\",\n",

       " 'I bought this based on all the positive reviews.... I guess there\\'s no substitution for taste!\\n\\nI\\'d say I don\\'t know what all the fuss is about, but I guess if you\\'re willing to put enough hours in then the gritty reality is quite moving and that\\'s what give it such positive reviews.  Also the graphics and ambience music is good.   BUT THAT\\'S ALL!  Now onto the bad points...\\n\\nIt\\'s boring.  Really boring, dull af.  I managed about half an hour before nodding off and landing in a heap on the floor.  The pace is sooooooo slow.  Exacerbated by the fact that....\\n\\nYou can\\'t save and reload.  I kinda understand the point of rogue-like games - they\\'re purposefully designed to be difficult and cruel to give people a challenge.  That\\'s all well and good when a game is entertaining and challenging (yet relatively quick) but when you\\'re putting hours and hours into dull pointing and clicking (more on this later) and building things and scavaging for resources.  In that case when you screw up due to the completely unavoidable pitfalls of the game, then it\\'s going to be really annoying that you\\'ve lost all that tedious work you\\'d put into it.\\n\\nSo coming back to the controls.  I mean the game literally is just point and click.  There are next to no keyboard shortcuts.  How about just the arrow keys for panning around the screen to save excessive mouse dragging around?  How about being able to number my characters 1,2,3 rather than having to tab-cycle through them each one.  How about even just a shortcut to open your inventory?  The old LucasArts adventure games of 20 years ago had better controls than this!\\n\\nThis is exacerbated by having to do everything manually.  You have to tell people to eat, to cook, to close doors; when you click \"grab all\" when looting, it doesn\\'t clsoe the inventory screen that is an extra step.  Everything about it is long winded, laborious, and monotous.\\n\\nAnd what\\'s more is the 2D thing.  2d games are all well and good when it\\'s implemented effectively, but this isn\\'t.  I couldn\\'t bulid a bed in a perfectly good part of the house because there was a staircase in front of it.... IN FRONT of it.  Why can\\'t I put the bed behind it?  Same again in another room, couldn\\'t place a bed because there was a wardrobe BEHIND it in this case.  Why not just put the bed in front of the wardrobe?  Well leave enough of a gap to open the doors obviously.  It\\'s difficult to explain without seeing but it just feels odd, it means that our little shelter for 3 people is really crammed and short on space, when it looks like a mansion.  A run down mansion obviously, but a big one.  If that was a 3D world/game, you could have about 10 people living in there quite comfortably.   But because the house is apparently only 3 feet in depth (despite the graphics portraying a spacious deep room) we have to scatter our stuff all over a really wide area.\\n\\nPeople say the game really makes you feel the horrors of living and surviving in a war torn country.

If you want to get a sense of what being trapped in a war-ravaged area would be like, then this is a great game. However, the game itself is seldom fun and usually punishing. The challenge is really just trying to survive as long as possible. The problem is that surviving is often a depressing endeavor. There's hardly ever any joy to be had.

This sounds like a strange thing to mention but in fact it puts the icing on the cake. While it could be fun to find out what is worth to go for (like producing lots of alcohol or cigarettes to exchange for food or to go for producing food to exchange for materials) you just do not get the time for that because your characters are always not fully operational and/or always need supplies you just don´t have which leads to even more problems which are stalling any progress in building up the house.

       " 'This is a difficult game to write a review about at all. Ever since its release, it\\'s gathered such a crazy that the \"consequences\" for saying something bad rivals Darkest Dungeon. It\\'s not that this is a particularly bad game but it has the usual rogue-like schtick attached to it.\\n\\nThe story is what gathered a lot of attention, from my understanding. Ignoring the rumours about how exaggerated the comparison is to the real life events, it\\'s a pretty good concept regardless. You control a group of unlucky survivors that are stuck in a war-zone, unable to escape because both rebels and army will kill them if they attempt to. From what I understand, this game goes on forever until you lose all of your survivors. I\\'ve never been one to take most themes used in video games too seriously so this game didn\\'t make me feel depressed. Maybe more melancholy but I can only assume that by \"depressing\" most people are referring to the way that the game works and how it causes a feeling of depression, or alternatively empathy for people in a shitty situation.\\n\\nThe gameplay isn\\'t as great as you\\'d expect from a survival-base-managing game. Essentially the day-to-night process of each day goes as such :\\n\\n1) Wake up and perform tasks at base(building/upgrading facilities, refueling fire, eating, sleeping, medicine and or bandages, speaking to visitors / trader, etc.)\\n\\n2) End the day or wait until the timer ticks away. You then hit the night prep phase in which you choose what each person does, from a selection of scavenge(1 person per night), sleep(on a bed or on the floor) and guard.\\n\\n3) Night phase in which you either didn\\'t send anyone to scavenge(in which case see step 1 and repeat) or you sent someone to scavenge. The scavenging phase consists of you moving around an area and, depending on where you are, you\\'re either save to go busting through doors like an action movie star and yelling at people to barter with you or you are sneaking around not trying to be 1HKO\\'d by someone with a gun. I *think* you need to leave before the timer ends or else you lose your character, but I\\'ve never waited to see.\\n\\nPretty basic process. Step 1 has no real issues because a lot of its issues come from the rest of the game. Step 2, the night prep phase, is a nightmare depending on the situation. I had someone who was lethally wounded, and no matter what they would *not* heal. I had them sleeping every night for a good 7 or so days and bandaging when I could. This stems from the fact that there\\'s a consistent degradation of 1 \"level\" of status per day, so if you\\'re out of bandages and you\\'re not finding 1 bandage per night, you\\'re absolutely screwed. This also messes up your night prep because, in my experience, you\\'ll eventually need 2 people to guard even if you have patched up all the holes in your home. There\\'s also a managing of who does what when. If you have people guard during the night, they need to rest the next night or during the following day, meaning you have to have x amount of beds, x being the amount of people who will be tired from guarding + the scavenger. This especially becomes an issue when someone is sick or wounded becase if they don\\'t rest, their sickness/wound gets worse. You also need to guard every night because, from what I gathered in every single one of my runs, the raids are completely RNG randomized as to whether not they happen each night.This plus the taken sleep slot(s) and your game essentially spirals into a deep dark hole if you\\'re unlucky. Basically, it\\'s painfully exhausting to manage it while also combatting an issue in phase 3.\\n\\n...And that brings us to aforementioned phase 3. Let\\'s just get this out there : This game is fueled by RNG. It\\'s a roguelike and, even if roguelikes didn\\'t exist off of rng, this game would not exist without it. That\\'s an awful fact that you have to deal with when playing this game. It just is not and NEVER will be a fun mechanic to play against but the issue is that this game runs off of it as a required mechanic. In phase 3, you explore the selected scavenging location and you go around nabbing at whatever you can get your hands on in the many spots you can search. I think all characters have 10 or 12 inventory slots, except for one character in one of the starter group setups. I never found anything that could increase inventory limit, so as far as I\\'m concerned you\\'re stuck with a pretty small inventory. Aside from location-specific story loot, I can only assume that loot is randomized upon the *first* entry of the map and I\\'ve had times where I\\'ve searched a few containers and only found a SINGLE item in the container, meaning I got 1 item from that search. Not one item with a stack of 3, but a single individual item(I think it was water which is a pathetic enough result to cause a ragequit). This is an inherent issue of RNG and, honestly, it persists throughout the entire game so much so that if you\\'re looking for certain items to make any kind of progress, you probably won\\'t even clear out every area unless you get cold feet and don\\'t want to venture into dangerous locations. So, yeah, the RNG loot is fucking ass. \\n\\nThe combat is pretty bad too but it\\'s mostly because you can only ever send one person out to scavenge. Presumably because controlling more than one person would be too difficult and to make the game really difficult in general. Without body armour, a shotgun takes 2 hits to kill you, a pistol 3-4~, and an assault rifle burst 1 hit. Even being punched by enemies, I had a character go to near-death in about 5 or so hits. It\\'s pretty fucking asinine if you ask me and it just serves to pad the game. I had to restart a lot of times because if a character dies, it completely fucks up your game. Not only is it really rare to have a survivor visit your base, it takes away an extra survivor to sub in for scavenge or guarding as well as base-maintaining. It also causes severe happiness issues to the point you might as well just restart. There is a good thing about combat, though. You can insta-kill enemies with a melee weapon if they\\'re right in front of you when you\\'re hiding. This, however, causes depression. 2 kills in a single night caused my survivor to break, meaning you can\\'t control them and they\\'re essentially comatose. I assume eventually your survivors get used to it, but I had killed several people and they *still* wouldn\\'t stop bitching about it as if it was their first kill. Your survivors even have a happy thought if you kill bandits and yet the one who kills them still gets severe happiness loss. Shouldn\\'t there be reduced happiness drop if you\\'re killing a bad person? It\\'s not like killing someone drives you insane. Honestly, it\\'s a really unbalanced consequence considering how the late-game locations are extremely dangerous and sneaking around is pretty difficult. \\n\\nThat\\'s more or less the gist of the phase 3 stuff. Terrible RNG consistently screwed me over in terms of loot, to the point that I had to keep on restarting until I would actually get enough food and materials to make any kind of progress, and it\\'s incredibly easy to go stagnant in this game. A game where food is extremely limit but materials aren\\'t and you just never have enough inventory space or even enough food to do 5 trips to the same location.\\n\\nThe game isn\\'t terrible, it\\'s just that I personally found it to be extremely unbalanced and unfair. Maybe that was the point because, hey, war is unfair and you should totally implement that as a \"feature\" in a game! The game is just painfully difficult and exhausting to play and, when it comes down to it, it\\'s mostly because of RNG ruling the hell out of this game. The same issues that exist in Darkest Dungeon exist in this game as per its genre. You consistently get shitty loot? Restart, because loot doesn\\'t refresh and you sure as hell aren\\'t going to get a break. Why play a doomed game when you can restart over and over until you eventually get that perfect game?',\n",

I haven\\'t played them, but I have watched some gameplay and read some reviews, enough to see how far the DLC go. This game has some pretty good ideas behind it, but I have to say that...\\n\"[its] execution deserves execution\", as certain somebody expressed about another game.\\n\\nI really hate the fact that the UI is so in-your-face when it doesn\\'t have to be. You could have your cursor hovered over something to get the bubble pop up instead or have your cursor change texture to indicate an action for something in particular.\\n\\nAside from the game\\'s bugs, the mechanics are really undeveloped, scenario wise. Here\\'s some ways that I think could certainly improve the game:\\n\\n* SO MUCH missed potential with events; some parts are blocked off. In one of the houses, a door is blocked by a bath that you CAN\\'T REMOVE! For some reason everything isn\\'t deconsctructable/hackable, which would make sense to be possible to do, I mean, if you see a TV or empty a fridge, woudn\\'t it make sense to deconstruct them for parts and specifically mechanical partsinstead of finding that shit only in rubbles, shelves and FUCKING WARDROBES, WHO KEEPS ELECTRONICS IN A WARDROBE?! Imagine being able to lay a ladder somewhere to get down, or being actually able to eat/take pills/ apply bandages WHILE scavenging. It would free up a slot and would actually make sense if your scavenging character has needs catered to. Such dumb!\\n\\n* Doors blocked off with wooden bars should be, but for some stupid reason are not HACKABLE WITH A HATCHET! Like WHY CAN\\'T I HACK A DOOR?! It seems like the perfectly logical and game-balanced way to do this.\\n\\n* Actually NOT have +2 upgrades for the table, and instead may be just have 1?\\n\\n* You know how you can be raided by thugs during the night? How about making that less predictable so I don\\'t get a sense of knowing when to put more of my guard on or not. Moreover, what about putting in effort for creating scenarios of defending your own house as well? \\n\\n* Homeless... how are the people inhabiting certain uildings possible to call homeless when they have a shelter? They may be poor, poorer than you (or not, if you have fuck all left for resources to a point of being screwed, in which case, what\\'s the difference between you, them, and any other average survivor?), but not homeless, unless they\\'re nomading because they can\\'t find a decent shelter, which doesn\\'t happen; the \"homeless\" that you find in one place at one point you\\'ll see there all the time, they don\\'t move! So how can you call them homeless? It also brings me to my next point, which is...\\n\\n* Things in places you\\'ve visited before almost completely DON\\'T CHANGE. Kill a thug, you\\'d expect the other thugs to be more alert that time, may be even try to track you, increasing your chance of being raided and attacked relentlessly, but NOPE! But even if it did...\\n\\n* Your characters NEVER kill ANYONE that raids your house. There isn\\'t any type of hostage system in the game either! At best, you just waste some ammo, at worst you\\'ll lose items, which I have not had happen to me at all. Honestly, considering how easy it is for you to rob other places, shouldn\\'t it be about just as easy for others . This huge difference in mechanics from your playable characters and game-play mechanics with other NPCs and implied scenarios are completely dumbfounded  with huge differences in how they function, even conceptually, to a point where it doesn\\'t feel like you\\'re in a world of actual war as an insignificant citizen, trying to survive war right by your doorstep, but more like your characters are the cliched protagonists of the given \"story\" you\\'re presented with.\\n\\n* Going out scavenging you can only have ONE character. There\\'s no AI for another character to help you out and carry more stuff back, while your house keeps getting raided by multiple people, based on the dialogue after being raided, or any co-op mode to compromise for it in any way.\\n\\n* How is an intruder coming in and trying to rob you a \"raid\"? Wouldn\\'t a raid need to have you having lost something from the robbery? It would be such an easy distynction to make, but instead the game makes you worried for a second for you then to realise that they didn\\'t steal anything, nothing really happened and you just lost some bullets.\\n\\n\\nThere is a reason why I am saying all of this here, in a review and not as suggestions in the discussion forum; it\\'s because I, and everybody else knows that developers won\\'t do shit to improve the game except may be try to fix some glitches IF you give them your save file. They don\\'t give a fuck! They found a way to make a good mula and they put in the effort to make an excuse for it, not actually present a well-crafted experience, not even with the Father\\'s Promise DLC, which has old dialogue that makes no sense in context of the sotry; \"\"We manage to fend them off this time, but I\\'m afraid they\\'re just testing our defences\" - Adam. WHO ARE THE \"WE\"?! You\\'re the only sad fucker in your house you nitwhit, and there\\'s NOBODY guarding it, who tf are you blaming it on?! And how is your house still not robbed, consindering NOBODY\\'s guarding it?! Dialogue is dumb. Grammatical errors and such are certainly forgivable, but dialogue in general is little to none and doen\\'t reflect personality of characters at all, it\\'s all the same for all of them, except for their bios... WHICH, btw, don\\'t reflect situations well either; if a character falls severely ill and you have meds everyone will whine about them needing to FIND meds, not that they just need to give them to the ill character, and may be also get the heating going if that\\'s part of the cause, but to GET them... problem is, they HAVE meds, have had meds for a while, and I\\'m just not giving any because the heater isn\\'t on or I was trying to preserve the meds for a bad day and let the character take the cheaper pills instead.',\n",

That said it did not manage to engage me at all. After an additional 3 hours I realised something: Nothing was going to happen.

Now onto my opinion about this game.\\n\\nTo be honest, the game's a bit dissappointing. The game get's really boring once you figure out how all the game mechanics work and I did in just 4 hours and it all seems repetitive now but not because of trying to survive everyday of course, characters feel bland even with their own journals/opinions towards the player's decisions on events and they seem to share much of the same dialogue the rest of the whole game, the game also is a bit buggy even after all these years such as random crashes after revisiting a location you haven't been in a long time, NPCs not functioning properly such as being too late or failng to tell you that the area is off limits then immediately become hostile towards you, NPCs becoming hostile for no reason(Although this is rare and has only happened to me twice), also the base game only has 1 map for some reason.

       " 'Walk into a hospital. A soldier tells you to behave yourself, so you violently chop up the chair he’s currently sitting on for firewood, then sell it back to the nearest doctor. Then you go home and build a guitar using only wood, gears, and a broken guitar. \\n\\nI really like what this War of Mine is trying to do, but I’m not a fan of the execution. The game centers around resource management and crafting in the style of civilians trapped in a city under siege. As you fight to survive, you’ll have to build beds, make alcohol, gather firewood, and scrounge the ruined cities. \\n\\nCharacters are well developed through their updating bios, Bruno especially. The game has a striking somber tone and grey scale art style which is especially wonderful to see during the winter scenarios. However, I think the most tragic thing about the game is the pacing. A typical story lasts 45 in game days. That’s a long time when there\\'s only a maximum of 24 scavengable locations and most of those will be inaccessible at any given time due to either a raging battle or snow. \\n\\nThe war in This War of Mine doesn\\'t actually effect the game that much. Sure, there are locations guarded by soldiers. Sure, you can hear shells in the ambience. But bandits and snow are a far greater threat than anything the military in this game has to offer. Shells will never hit your house and break your defenses. Battles will never occur outside your shelter. Rebel fighters will never hold you up at gunpoint for supplies as all attacks on your shelter happen off screen. Without some context to ground the player in the setting of an ongoing civil war, the game might as well be set immediatley after a nuclear apocalypse because the ongoing battle on its own has no meaning. This War of Mine isn\\'t your war at all.\\n\\nThe point is that once you get past the game’s unique premise, there’s not a lot to do. Once you have your essentials and are generating some tradable items, you can skip most of your time in the shelter. The difficulty curve is initially a sharp climb because you don’t know what to expect. Once you know what locations need what item and which items are the most useful, the difficulty curve hits freefall at terminal velocity. The result is that you have everything you need to survive and trade with around Day 20 and then have nothing to do for the remaining 25 days. Once I realized this, I decided to raid army strongholds just for fun. \\n\\nI wish I had more to say, but overwhelmingly I was just bored. Returning from scavenging was always the same. Send tired people to bed, feed someone, make moonshine, see if trader will show up, skip to night, repeat. The scavenging can throw a few curveballs with enemies and a tiny inventory, but that just wasn’t enough to keep me engaged. I appreciate what this game is trying to do and the message it sends, but as a game I think it falls short.\\n\\nStrong game design is about short term goals and long term goals. ExamIple from Monopoly: My long term goal is to make other players bankrupt. To do that, I\\'m going to buy this property at all costs. \\nThis War of Mine asks you to make your own short term goal (what supplies you need) and also your long term goal (finishing the game). The game provides no hints about when its ending is coming or how to achieve it until the late game. This leaves players stranded around the half way point as they have no overarching task to complete. All you can do is wait and continue to amass a dragon\\'s hore of supplies. This uncomfortable lull makes the game feel like a cheap mobile app rather than a cohesive interactive experience. There\\'s another way to complete the game, but it requires sufficient planning (or luck) and it\\'s locked on a timer. There\\'s nothing to hold you until the ending and when it happens it\\'s incredibly underwhelming. \\n\\nEdit: After finishing the game with all my survivors still alive, I think I know why I got bored. Too much water. It\\'s such a simple thing, but it\\'s true. With 2 rain water collectors, you can collect 16 water per day for the price of 12 scrap. That water is then used to make alcohol, grow food, or grow meds and tobacco, all of which are trading staples. You can collect 16 gallons of rain water in 12 hours when its not even raining outside. You don\\'t even need to boil or otherwise sanatize your water. I never took water from scav locations because I had near unlimited amounts of it. By the end of the game, I was trading 25 gallons of water for 30+ pieces of scrap, to make more water, to make more alcohol. I didn\\'t need anything because if I ever ran low on food (I didn\\'t) I could just trade more water for food. Water is, in my opinion, the single most overpowered resource in the entire game. \\n\\nWhat\\'s underpowered, undervalued (to new players), and underavailible is electronic components. You don\\'t know how much you need until you already upgrade your workbenches, which is punishing to new players. There seems to be a finite number of this resource, but they\\'re not especially important unless your entire strategy is to make your own cigs, food, and medicene.\\n\\nFinal thought: The inventory system also doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to me, even for a video game. 15 cigs take up the same backpack space as 2 wooden planks or 4 piles of scrap? 15 cigs take up the same space as 20 bullets? Do you, player, really believe that? The limiting of these small objects doesn\\'t make me weigh the pros and cons of cigs vs wood, it just tells me \"buy it from the merchant instead.\" As a result, you can ignore luxuries entirely until your house has become the local brewery.  It\\'s even worse since there are three different types of cigs and different types don\\'t stack in the same inventory slot. So if you have 1 tobacco cig, 1 quality roll-up, and 1 roll-up you\\'re using the same inventory space as 6 wood planks OR 12 pieces of scrap. All of this points to the conclusion that inventory should have been based on weight instead of slot, because otherwise players have no need to weigh the pros and cons, there is always a definite right answer. Not all characters want luxuries and there\\'s no penalty for not getting people thier coffee or cigs so I rewarded my survivors with cigs and coffee because, again, I had nothing else to do. I was bored.',\n",

       " 'UPDATE: Having played through the DLC, I can\\'t recommend this game for the following reasons.\\n\\n- Only one of the three promised stories DLCs came out\\n- The stories DLC is very short if you are good at the game\\n- The stories DLC writing isn\\'t very good and is very predictable\\n- The pencil effect and the flashing lights triggered a twitch in my eye, and I wasn\\'t able to turn off the pencil effect entirely, nor could I turn off the flashing lights. I get that it\\'s part of the visual aesthetic, but, if annoying flashing stuff bothers you, this is really not the game for you.\\n- One achievement seems broken. Namely, if you escape the city via a boat, with a kid in your group, you do not unlock the achievement for survivng the war with a kid, the way you would if you just stayed in your house until the end of the war. Maybe this is a technical issue. I\\'m not taking points off for this, but, it\\'s very annoying.I ran through the game again, on a short 20 day run with a ton of mods, to basically rush to the end, to finally unlock that achievement...even though in my opinion, it should\\'ve been unlocked when I escaped via the boat.\\n\\nIf the rest of the promised DLC came out, if the DLC was better, and if the visual effects could have those visual screws removed, I\\'d give this a positive review.\\n\\nOLD REVIEW:\\n\\nEver wish \"The Sims\" could be really sad? This is the game for you. This is a game I like so much that I bought it on Android too. Don\\'t do that, you\\'ll stay up all night playing it.\\n\\nThis War Of Mine puts you in charge of a group of survivors in a city. You control every character as you manage things like scavenging, fighting, bartering, crafting, and doing things around your shelter. Your choices matter, and you get epilogues at the end of each game, regarding all your characters, as well as recap of major events that happened.\\n\\nThis is not a game that forces you to be good. This game doesn\\'t force you to be anything, but you\\'ll find yourself compelled to donate bandages to a hospital, or to give medicine to kids...or, as your survivors starve, to murder an innocent elderly couple and steal their food to save your own. You can play a pure good or pure evil run, but you\\'ll find it increasingly hard to stick to either path, and probably end up somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThis is not a game where good is arbitrarily rewarded more than evil. Evil is by far the most \"comfortable\" run for your survivors, because other than moral penalties and some risks of death, stealing is a lot more lucrative than scavenging. A lot of games make good the more rewarding choice in-game, with rewards that are literally better, so it\\'s no question as to what side a player chooses. Given that evil is the side with better rewards in This War Of Mine, resisting the temptation to take the easy way and rob to get what you want is hard than it would be in another game.\\n\\n\\nThe game includes:\\n\\n- Stealth\\n\\n- Fighting\\n\\n- Trading\\n\\n- Crafting\\n\\n- Loot management\\n\\n- Survival game stuff\\n\\n- Sim game stuff\\n\\n- Time management\\n\\nIt\\'s a lot like Oregon Trail...if Oregon Trail didn\\'t have a wagon but instead, a house in a city devastated by war that stood in the city...as the city fell apart around the house.\\n\\nYou can customize your game or do a preset campaign.

Annoyingly when they raised their fists my guy decided to give up escaping a bunch of invalids and instead run back into the death brawl with a crowbar and start splitting skulls.\\nAt this point its pretty impossible to tell what the fuck is happening when you have half a dozen gray progerians attacking each other with the same exact animations (animations which end when interupted but still give damage) so my guy got out on fuck all health after killing the entire shantytown, forcing him to be bed ridden for half a week and get my entire group into a state of depression.\\nThat\\'s right, whenever you kill someone while looting (even in self defence) some characters will instantly neglect their own survival because of some mysterious sixth sense they have for comrade killings. (Even if their friend informs them, why would they? Some characters are complete psychopaths who dont care about killing others)\\n\\nIt gets so much worse when you encounter people with guns.\\n\\nThe game neglects to tell you that each character has different combat traits, some having the power to backstab while others dont, which leads to some real shitty situations where you attempt to backstab someone, causing them to turn around pitting you in a button mashing grapple as you both trade slaps until his buddy runs in and shoots through him to kill you.\\n\\nEven when you get the drop on someone it never matters, even with full armour you still have less health than most of the enemies in this game, even thugs. So when you shoot a guy half a dozen times with the assault rifle, there is literally nothing stopping them from pulling out their own gun and shooting you, causing you to lose half of your health, getting stunned for half a minute, then watching your character slowly crawl to cover like they lost their spine in the firefight.\\n\\nEven cover in this game is useless since your character seems to slowly walk to it, go into it, then exit it to hide behind something invisible, so when the enemies sprint into the room they run past the cover and point blank execute you.\\n\\nFor a game putting heavy emphasis on atmosphere, it kinda breaks when animations go from \"eh they tried\" to \"why are they squid people?\". Its ridiculous when characters are fighting for their lives and they enact the exact same animation four times in a row for stabbing someone infront of them and then freeze into position every time the animation ends so the enemy gets the chance to recover and then hit you with their own meele.\\nYou can even wipe out the entire map if you find a crack in the scenery to hide in, lure enemies with footsteps and then kill them as they walk past, then their friends will run over to the pile of their friends and get hooked by an arm 3 feet infront of them and then stabbed in the dick half a dozen times.\\n\\ntl;dr\\nGame puts massive effort into its realistic atmosphere, however the combat feels like a game of Worms.',\n",

Why? Because the developers are idiots.\\nThere's no balance. It seems they thought forcing you to die from unbalanced gameplay would convey the message of the struggles of being in a warzone. Instead it conveys the message that these devs no nothing of game design. I've got a few hours on record but most of those hours you're just staring at the screen waiting for hours to go by and things to get done, there's no way to speed up time so you just have to sit through it all.

       " \"I bought this game hoping for something different and interesting more than something I expected to get a lot of joy out of.  The theme is a bit dark to expect joy from after all.  My expectations were fairly low going in.  They needed to be a lot lower.\\n\\nTechnically, the game works fine.  I didn't encounter any bugs that I noticed, and it looks good.  You can almost forget its 2D at times thanks to the art.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that's where my appreciation has to end.  The developers have made so many choices, clearly deliberate choices, that simply ruin any enjoyment I might otherwise get from the game.  The first one I noticed was that I can only ever send one guy out scavenging.  I couldn't understand that decision for the life of me, but I could deal with it.\\n\\nThe bigger problem (for me) hit me soon after.  Crafting.  Crafting in this game is nonsensical.  The same materials make crowbars and water filters.  The sorts and amounts of materials you need for doing most anything are... seemingly random.  They don't change or anything, they just don't make sense.  \\n\\nThe crafting materials themselves don't make much sense either.  They clearly wanted to make things simple, and streamlined, and as some one who has actually made most of the things you can “make” in this game... just no.  Much of it is actually harder to “make” in game than it is to actually make (looking at you water filters) while other things (crowbar, for example) are far to easy to make... and break so quickly that they're clearly crude approximations of their namesakes, but work far too well for such.  I suppose that's par for the survival game course, but I still find it jarring.\\n\\nCrafting baffles me again with it's prerequisites.  You need to upgrade your workbench before you can... board up the gaping holes in the wall.  Uh.... no.  A rock (a rock tied to a stick is much less injury prone), and some nails you fished out of the ashes after burning some reclaimed wood will work.  It isn't fun, but it does function, so long as the nails aren't too rusted away.  (Yeah, I've done this too.  Hammer's are awesome.)\\n\\nSo, the crafting was just too gamey for me.  If that won't bother you, then it won't bother you.\\n\\nAnother gamey thing is how fast plants grow.  Even radishes don't grow that fast.  Maybe bean sprouts?  If so, where did the beans come from, and why didn't you just eat them?\\n\\nThen there's the fact that you can just start a fire, whenever... somehow.  The only way that makes sense is if you have Bruno, the compulsive smoker.  I figure he had a lighter (major currency item in under siege Sarajevo btw).  Otherwise, well, I find it hard to believe that the characters in game were all that good with a bow drill, or a sun lens, or even know what char cloth is.\\n\\nMy biggest issue with the game was the characters.  The game asks you “how far will you go to protect the people you care about?”  I quickly realized that I didn't care about any of these characters, at all.  Maybe there was some hidden info to make you more invested in them that I missed.  If there is, well, that sort of thing probably shouldn't be hidden.\\n\\nWith some exceptions, the characters in this game are... well, they're sort of people I moved to the middle of the woods to get away from.  They don't know anything useful. They get upset about things that make no sense, and they care more about their addictions now than having food tomorrow.  I've known six year old children that would be more useful in a survival situation than some of these characters.\\n\\nI do find these characters believable.  I also find myself uninterested in their plight.  In a game that asks me to care, and to do things because I care... well.. it's a bridge too far, on top of the wonky crafting, miracle gardens, and solitary hero salvage runs.\\n\\nIn the end, I just don't care, and that just kills the game, for me at any rate.\",\n",

You can still add kids to your custom game and have your custom characters in the create a story, but half of the shelter is cut off due to the fact you can\\'t access it, and your kids will have nothing to do but chat with the adults once a day. \\n\\nOh and there\\'s a bunch of stations already set up in the building (herbal workshop, garden on the other side of the blockcade, things like that. there\\'s even a couch) so your already limited shelter is limited further. It\\'s great to have those, but with limited things, having the garden on your side probably would have been more useful than the herbal workshop that you generally just use to make cigarettes.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping maybe this is all down because the devs are creating a much more in depth character creation (currently, you can only choose between a few certain classes for your character to be. You can\\'t write their backstory or connect them to characters you\\'ve already made or even give them special abilities and addictions, making your characters weaker in terms of ability and story telling, unlike the already scripted characters that are in game that will always have a story to each other on how they met.) which in turn will make a much more in depth mod workshop, but from what I\\'m seeing online, The Last Broadcast is being hailed as amazing, and no one has mentioned any bugs. I\\'m sure the DLC is amazing, but I bought the DLC I wanted, and my game should work without being forced to buy all the DLC. \\n\\nThank you for reading all the way down here, I recommend you find another story game to play, as this one is broken and likely will never be fixed.',\n",

Like seriously? are you that close minded?\\n4. No replay value. After you beat it once you got the full package. You can play again with slightly different places and people but in the end it changes nothing. I beat it in 2-ish hours.\\n5. No strategic value and relies heavily on luck (unless you google everything).\\n6. One-dimensional characters. No one actually brings up anything intelligent. Nor does the game put you in thought provoking or controversial situations. The best it had was a soldier raping a woman and you can\\'t stop him because he has an AK-47 and you have a knife. As mentioned above combat is ass so there is no possible way you can beat him through \"skill\".

It does, however, end in an emperor's new clothes style blanket positive reviews, as peoples' minds are blown that it realistically represents how experiencing a war must be, and they feel they must express this.

Even most of the locations are pretty similar.\\n\\nI think what kills the game for me personally, is the amount of resources needed to just survive is high, and the amount of resources needed to upgrade things is nearly impossible to achieve on anything but easy difficulty.

Just crazy.\\n\\nThe major thing I didn\\'t like about the game is that it appears to deliberately make life difficult for you.  Doesn\\'t matter what decisions you make, the game will find a way to level you out.  It\\'s like games like Oblivion where, when you finnaly get a God like sword and look forward to carving through swathes of monsters, you find the game has levelled up all the monsters so it\\'s no different.  Very unrewarding.\\n\\nSo here, if you have lots of timber and components and need cogs to make something, when you go out and scavenge you\\'ll find tons more timber and components and sweet FA cogs.\\n\\nIf your party has bandages but no meds, sure enough the characters will become sick leaving you stranded.  If you have meds but no bandages then sure enough, the house will be raided overnight and characters will be wounded and without bandages quickly deteriorate.\\n\\nThe moral aspects of the game are a horrible element imo.  Just stupid.   If the scavenger does anything remotely \"bad\" the whole party gets depressed.  I mean you\\'re surviving a war so stealing for example is highly likely to happen, but if you do it, expect the game to brutally punish you by dropping moral of the party.  Characters go from Sad, to Depressed to Broken pretty quickly and trying to recover that position once the juggernaut has started rolling is very difficult.  If you don\\'t have books or armchairs or coffee, smokes etc then it\\'s a quick decline.  The most stupid aspect is Broken status.  Your character won\\'t do anything at all.  Will just stand or sit there and is useless from that point on, may as well be dead.\\n\\nIn the final analysis it feels like you are just following the pre-programmed route for the game, you don\\'t really have choices, though it creates the illusion that you do.  You have to play the way the game wants you to or it stuffs you.\\n\\nThere are the basics of a good idea here, but as implemented it\\'s just a time waster that deliberately skews the numbers against you to prolongue the play time.  You win if the game wants you to win.\\nWhen you do finally win after all the hours and effort expended in monotnous repetitive actions, what do you get?

You have the ability to build rat traps (with the appropriate resources) but once you\\'ve built 2, the GAME doesn\\'t let you build more !  No reason why the characters couldn\\'t or shouldn\\'t, they have the resources, but no, the game just says no, 2 is it, I\\'m removing the option after that point.  \\n\\nSo, as I said, the game doesn\\'t let you get ahead.  You don\\'t really have choices.  You DO have to build a stove, a heater, a water distiller, beds etc.  No choice, you build them or die.  You can\\'t inventively do anything, you can\\'t out-think the game, you can\\'t therefore experiment how you might survive in such a war.   You are merely playing numbers.  X timbers + Y components = item.  Item + something else = another item.  etc etc.   Always on the back foot, always fighting a game that won\\'t let you get ahead.

The problem is, to me, that it\\'s not a great game.\\n\\nI love the game for it\\'s idea to give you a feeling of being stuck in a war as a civilian and how it tries to convey the hardship you would have to endure.\\nSadly it does it technically in such a bad, unnecessarily tedious way (like being able to scavenge only at night + only 1 person at a time) that it ends up scewing the whole experience.\\n\\nFurthermore the game is also very unrealistic. For example, a human can survive for about 30-40 days without food (if hydrated, and you would die around 45 - 60 days). Yet in the game, after two days of (still) eating a littlebit, they seem to begin to starve.\\nAlso water, unless there\\'s a chemical or radioactive fallout, it\\'s pretty safe to drink rainwater. You don\\'t need to construct a filter every day to use it, you can just boil it to be on the safe side. Not to mention you can just put a pot in the open to collect rainwater, why the need to build a complicated machine for it?\\n\\nFurthermore the graphics. I get it that the Developer wanted to convey a bleak feeling, but if you watch footage of the war in the Ukraine, Iraq, Nigeria, or Syria, it\\'s not all dark, grey and muddy. \\nSometimes the days look really beautiful and peaceful, like nothing as happened. That is what is so surreal about war, the cruelty and destruction thrown against the beautiful environment of a once thriving life - which is now crumbling under it\\'s horrors.\\n\\n\\nTo me it seems that the Developer didn\\'t do much research on life and survival in a war zone, and instead just did what he thought people would do in such a situation, and what it would be like. \\nHonestly, a lot feels forced and arbitrary to me. Like the Dev had to limit your possibilities to make you feel how hard war is. Which to me is a really bad choice, because it makes it feel unrealistic and like a \"game\", and not like a real experience.\\n\\nInstead make things meaningful - for example the limit of scavenging with only 1 person; Allow more than one to scavenge, but that would increase the risk of being overwhelmed in a raid. See? No artificial limitation and you immediately have a stronger impact of your gameplay choices, and a stronger experience of the hard choices to be made in a conflict.\\n\\n\\nWhat I really like about the game though is how some of the AI families react if you kill one of them. This is really well done.\\n\\n.\\n\\nSo overall I think, if the game was better designed - and more realistic, the emotional impact would have been much stronger and probably made people think about war much more.\\nNow it\\'s just an okay building / survival game with a war background. And if it hadn\\'t that, I am sure the overall rating would be much lower.\\n\\nI praise the Developer for trying, and for how it got people to talk about war (well, did it? How many of you actually did research furthermore into armed conflicts after playing the game?). Yet I just can\\'t recommend it. I wish there was a \"neutral\" option for reviews.\\n\\nSo my suggestion is to watch actual footage from armed conflicts, and donate the money directly to charities instead (like Doctors without Borders).

You're probably going to do each of those things within your first hour or two, then rinse, lather, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.\\n\\nIt wouldn't be so bad if there were a lot of different ways you could do those things, or some ways you could do them well or poorly, some variety, some challenge, but there's really not.  Most actions are accomplished at the push of one or two buttons, with no challenge in them whatsoever.  What matters in whether you succeed or not is whether you've managed to scrounge up the necessary materials in your scavanging attempts at night, and that's mostly a matter of luck, not skill -- though I suppose there's a little bit of skill involved, in that you have to avoid getting caught.  But other than that, it's all up to the random number generator, as to what junk will be available for you to scavange.\\n\\nThe rest of the game is mostly just applying common sense, like eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired, take meds when you're sick, etc.\\n\\nOcassionally there's a moral dillema such as: should you give away your very scarce and valuable meds to some kids who come begging for them to save their sick mother?  If you do, you've done a good deed, and your characters won't feel guilty, if you don't, you'll have the meds for yourself, and might be able to use them to save your own lives or barter them for something critical to your survival, but your characters will feel guilty and sad, and that will hurt their chances of survival.\\n\\nWhile the occasinal moral dillemas and the game's atmosphere are nice touches, they don't make up for the lack of options and variety.  I like complex games, where you can make many choices and have tons of options.  Even games like Civilization have too few options for me.  And I dread mentioning this game in the same sentence as Civilization.  There's really no comparison.  This is a simple, even simplistic game.  A simple game with few options, but good atmosphere and a fair dose of sadness.  If you're ok with that, you might like it.  I got bored after the first half hour, yet stuck with it for another couple of hours anyway.  It wasn't worth it.\\n\\nThe developers of the game made a nice try, and it's refreshing to see a game that doesn't pull many punches when it comes to showing the downsides of war (though even it could have gone a lot darker and deeper), but it's really not nearly deep enough to keep my interest.\",\n",

       " 'I was simply disappointed and use refund after 30min of gameplay and then some youtube watching. Why? This should be emotional experience and from the reviews I read, I should feel connected with character and their actions. But for me this simply didn’t work because of 2 reasons:\\n\\n1.\\tGame lacks some \"good production money\" - like for example Walking dead. I love characters in that game from the first minute and you can really tell what their personality is. In this game, everything you got is one photo and few sentences. There is no voices, no facial animation etc.\\n2.\\tGame mechanics. I\\'m simply not in the mood to find out if I should build a chair or a bed with given wood. Do I have enough wood to build everything? Should I choose wisely? Do I really need a bed? Should I build water dispenser first or oven is more important? In real life, there is so much more possibilities and you will know what you really need. In this game you have to learn (in hour? in 2? 5 hours?) just to \"please the game\" to move forward. I suppose that bad decision will result in sooner end (in fewer days). Should it evoke reality? Nah – in real life you will not decide between 5 actions. You will use all possibilities to survive. For example - when your character is hungry, there is the text \"hungry\" by his name. What does it mean? That he will die next day? Should I do anything to get him food? Or it\\'s fine to leave him hungry for 3-4 days? Can I decide to eat my friend? No – this game do not give you this possibility.\\n\\nI cannot help but to compare this game to walking dead. It’s very similar in terms of atmosphere, lack of resources and being attached to characters. But in WD, you have not to find out what to do or read it in some guide. You just simply absorb the atmosphere, story, personalities and are making hard decisions.\\n\\nAnd for 18,99€??? Are you kidding me? Only 4€ less than WD? But price is not the problem. I wouldn’t play this game even if it’s free. It’s simply not worth my time.',\n",

Altough they have been done before in some other sim-like games. And other survival stuff. You can see this as a 2D version from State of Decay. Well you can better play that game. It\\'s a bit more balanced then this one. Let me explain...\\n\\nThis games puts you in a house and immediatly there is already one person slightly sick, with only bandages at your disposal. Scavenging the house doesn\\'t give you anything usefull most of the time. Scavenging requires luck ! Sometimes you are in luck but then you are almost instantly faced with the most common line in this game: \"You can\\'t make this, find some more stuff... But I\\'m to tired, let me sleep\".\\n\\nI have tried all 3 options in the 77min. that I played the game. First try, second try (diff. house thankfully) and \\'Create\\' own story. The \\'create\\' part is very poor, choose people and the base-camp. The last option even makes the violence come sooner. And you can\\'t defend yourself because of the lack of resources.\\n\\nIn the end you can see this as a very hard version of The Sims (any of them). Your team just isn\\'t fast enough in getting the things you need / making items you need to stay alive. And the game doesn\\'t give you much tutorial as well. If you still like this concept then please play State of Decay. It\\'s easier on the player and still gives a challenge. (Only difference is Zombies instead of War).',\n",

       " \"This War of Mine is a story of civilian survival in a war torn city.\\n\\nThe core mechanics of the game essentially come down to resource management. \\n\\nThe basic resource categories you need to manage come down to these broad groups:\\n\\n1. Food (ex. raw meat)\\n2. Building Materials (ex. wood)\\n3. Weapons/Utilities (ex. lock picks)\\n4. Happiness (ex. cigarettes)\\n5. Healing (ex. medication)\\n6. Bartering (ex. diamonds)\\n\\nThe game uses a cycle of two times: night and day.\\n\\nDuring the day you will do things like:\\n\\n1. Cook food\\n2. Distill alcohol\\n3. Sleep\\n4. Set mouse traps\\n5. Grow vegetables \\netc.\\n\\nDuring the NIGHT you will go out and SCAVENGE.\\n\\nThe night is the more interactive part of the game. During the night you will look at your map and determine where you would like to scavenge in the city. Some locations (such as the Garage) will be relatively safe and have people for you to barter with. Other locations (such as the Construction Site) may not be safe. You may need to bring a weapon or be prepared to not be seen. The entire goal of scavenging is to bring back food, materials, medications, etc. for your party back at base camp. \\n\\nCriticisms:\\n\\nOverall, I feel like the game becomes very grindy. The fact that you can only carry a limited amount of resources with you while scavenging is realistic yet tedious. You will have to spend multiple nights scavenging the same location in order to loot all of it. While this feels realistic and reasonable, in practice it just becomes monotonous and repetitive. \\n\\nDay time phase is a bit of a hassle and simply becomes a routine. You will make water every day. You will put tired people in beds every day. You will cook every day/every few days. Basically day time is just a monotonous time sync as you go through the motions of keeping everyone healthy. And that's honestly what day time is - going through the motions. It's not fun, it's not interactive, and you do the same thing nearly every time. It's disappointing. \\n\\nWhat I enjoy about the game:\\n\\nI absolutely love the concept - it's clever and I have to give the studio props on originality. It's fresh and something I have never seen before. I like the resource management concept of the game - unfortunately I just didn't care for the way it was executed (too monotonous/going through the motions).\\n\\n\\nFinal Word:\\n\\nThere is A LOT more depth to this game than I have presented here, but I have presented the basic gist of the title. While the game is unique and original, it lacks engagement. There isn't much of a story and the gameplay is simply too repetitive.  I'm very torn on this title, as I want to recommend it but the game just isn't fun. The gamplay isn't strong enough and it becomes repetitive very fast.\\n\\n5.0/10\",\n",
       " \"On the positive side, it's an emotionally loaded, immersive game that makes an attempt to illustrate the horrors of war. The artwork is beautiful as well. It's therefore an important game and I'm glad to have bought it and experienced it. However, as a game it's not very good and I cannot recommend it. I get it that the point of this game is illustrating the helplessness of the civilian in wartime, but they could have done a better job of the game's mechanics. I've had two playthroughs where the same thing more or less happened: someone was killed scavenging, someone else got depressed because of that and a third one died of sickness, then the depressed one starved. Scavenging and crafting are very frustrating and once someone is sad you are basically done for. In short, it's a beautiful and sad game, and you should get it if you care for the emotional content.

I am really really dissappointed. I am expecting an actual game not a shitty simulation. The core gameplay mechanics is horrible, it just hid lies behind this wall of lies.

Yeah, I don't think so.  \\n\\nBut there's a very simple reason why I can't recommend this game: it's not procedural at all. \\n\\nEverything in this game is pre-determined, and how you beat it is also pre-determined. The claim of 'random events' is bogus, because in the short time I played this game, I was able to predict the time a trader would show up. Also, every building is the same each time you play.

The game is cool for about 2 hours, then the novelty of it wears off and then you realize you sank  20 bucks into a game that gives you about 1.5 hours of 'new stuff' to do. Seriously.

I was really hoping for an immersive story here- but you really just get dropped into a resource management scenario without any context, and by that, I don't mean that I was looking for an explanation to anything that was going on in the war, etc. I'm a huge dark souls fan- ambiguity doesn't bother me. The gameplay itself just feels weak. I wanted this game to captivate me. I wanted to sit down and love this game so much that I didn't want to do anything else on my free time. I wanted to love the protagonists, and feel bereft by the loss of them. I wanted to be bullied by soliders, and made to feel weak. I wanted to see newcasts of incredible tragedies and happen across riots in the middle of the streets. I wanted to be marked a criminal for having to make hard decisions for my survival. I wanted to run for my life, and genuinely fear that my rickety house might fall in on top of me during a missile strike. I wanted to meet other civilians whose lives were torn apart by this war, and hear their stories, whether I could do anything to help them or not. I wanted to escape the city, or negotiate peace. But in spite of all that I hoped for, I was made to grind- to micromanage three characters than I felt no attachment to and sit quietly while they took several minutes to sift through piles of rubble, grab a couple resources, consume the ones my characters needed, rinse & repeat. I have Survival games in my library that work much better mechanically- so this didn't give me anything. It was boring me to tears for what little time I could stand to sit with it. And I tried to come back to this game, I read the reviews, I watched the videos again, hoping it could promise me that there was something more than what I was seeing, but there isn't. And I'm really bummed about that. I just can't pick this one up. It's too dull.\",\n",

I\\'d then answer they really give up hope fast, and then I\\'ll add : why the hell they kept on saying \"she\\'s been shot like a dog\" ..?!?

       " 'This is one of the hardest decisions for a review I\\'ve had in a very long time.  Overall, I\\'m giving it a thumbs down primarily due to \"my\" perception of a lack of proper basic training provided by the developer and a community I found to be a majority of cruel fanboys.\\n\\nWhat I enjoyed:\\nFirst off, major kudo\\'s for the developing team for concieving and delivering a simulation of the realities of war, as told by the innoncent bystander.  So many war games give the player a sense of immortality and reward for senseless and mindless destruction, war is quite devistating and this simulator portrays this extremely well.  The graphics are quite good, they\\'re crisp and clear yet dark and hazy...  perfect!  The human stories you encounter help a great deal to pull you into the story line, well done.  The activities in the game seam quite realistic for the environment and was pleased to see that fear, concern, empathy, and hatred all exist within the encounters.  Each game is different, so there\\'s plenty of replayability in this simulator.  There\\'s not much help in the way of instructions, no list of commands to look up, you just get tossed into the game and have to figure it out.   I both liked this and hated it at the same time.  The first day you are introduced to several game play mechanics which do an excellent form of learning the game mechanics.  You\\'re digging, scavenging, building, breaking into all sorts of things.  You get used to the interface pretty quick, but there are several things it doesn\\'t teach you, which brings me to what I didn\\'t like...\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t enjoy:\\nSince there are no instructions (and again, I partially like that fact), I spent a good deal of time searching YouTube for instructional videos and tips.  Enduring several hours of listening to fanboys who love to hear themselves talk on and on about the most mundane of thoughts, I was able to pickup that in the game there is combat, the ability for characters to interact with each other, a few things that help you and your group suvive.  These abilities are not intuitive in the game and appear to have some combination of setting or events to make them happen that are not obvious, I\\'ve figured out combat finally, but little else.  Despite all the videos, all that I\\'ve seen is that you need to do these things, none cover HOW to do these things.  Aside from gameplay, these missing lists of commands would be very handy when setting up a custom game.  I am unable to create one because the map requires I pick some 24 city locations and I can\\'t get the interface to do anything more than toggle to loctions I pick and won\\'t maintain my selection.  \\n\\nSo like many other players have posted, the game sets you up to fail and it\\'s down right fustrating.  Having a house full of squatters/survivors you would think you could send out a large party to bring home several scavenged items.  Nope, only one person can go out for supplies a night, while the rest sit around and complain about how hungry, wounded, and sad they are.\\n\\nSome of the game mechanics don\\'t quite work as expected.  Once you steal items from a location, every repeat visit by \"anyone\" to that same location is treated as a theft even if you only scavanged and didn\\'t steal anything and further increases everyone\\'s sadness and it\\'s just a few runs before everyong is breaking down emotionally.\\n\\nOverall, it didn\\'t take long before I felt like playing this simulator was just pointless and a waste of my time.  Despite really being drawn to the game concept, I\\'m just not enjoying this game and as such can\\'t give it a thumbs up.',\n",

For example, you kill ANYONE and the entire fucking team get depressed and starts questioning life and shit. I started my second playthrough, and was sneaking through a church and found this guy bragging about killing the priest who shelterd the sick and homeless during the war. The man was taking all of the church\\'s stuff after killing everyone there, and when he spotted me tried to shoot me. So I stabbed the little shit to death. I take what I need, and go home. Hell, I even sparred another group of people a house over who ended up chasing after me with an AK-47, and when I had the chance to stab one, I decided to let them go. Then I get home and character is \"depressed\" and won\\'t stop moaning about how ashamed she was of what she did. Come on, that\\'s ridiculous. To make things worse, the rest of the team becomes sad. I can understand people getting sad when you steal from the elderly, but I genuinly can\\'t engage even the most bloodthirsty tyrants without everyone getting sad. Stop trying to make me feel bad for killing murderers, because I don\\'t feel bad about it. Additionally, the difficulty is fun at first, but just gets stupid at some points. It gets to the point where your people are getting sick and injured for no reason. I keep a furnace with kindling in it 24/7 to keep my place warm, yet everyone gets sick because of the cold 2/3 of my team ended up terminally ill as well. I put people on gaurd every night, and build defnses, yet we get raided every night. A hard game is fine, but a cheating game is not. If I can\\'t counter these problems, why put them in and pretend I can counter them? An interesting idea, but it needs some polishing before I can reccomend it.',\n",

The only personality can be found in their character cards, which you barely read. The lines they speak are few and repetitive, as well as not reflecting their \\'personality\\'. As the characters feel like mindless robots under the control of my mouse, I felt absolutely no sympathy when one of my survivors died on day 14, nor do I feel any compassion for any of the other remaining survivors in \\'loot\\' houses. It may just be me, but somehow the game doesn\\'t trigger my \\'feels\\' knob.\\n\\nThe slow pace of the game doesn\\'t help either in getting me exited.

I suppose that the art and music are quite fitting to the theme at first, but I was quickly desensitized to them and muted the music. After a while the idea of being in a war slipped my mind and I felt I was playing a grinding game to obtain just 5 items: Wood, parts, components, meat and water. You don\\'t need more. The additional items just come as a bonus when grinding for the essentials, or as a result of trade. The complexity of the game is very low, as it doesn\\'t really excite my to play any further. Some days, were so useless, I came back from the night, put them in bed, and pressed \"End day\". I couldn\\'t be bothered by anything else. If only you could send multiple scavengers a night, so it might be worthwhile to accommodate more people whose only purpose is to eat your food.\\n\\nIn conclusion, nice music and art style for the first hour or so, then becomes repetitive and tedious to play.

       " 'Edit: Played for another few hours, just to be absolutely sure I wasn\\'t missing something. \\n\\nEventually a place cropped up to barter...great! Oh, they keep coming. Around 80-90% (no exagguration) of my locations were occupied by other survivors, thugs, or military. There was nothing left to do but \\'be the bad guy\\' and resort to stealing from these people which gets really difficult once they start pointing guns. There was no way you could build all the cool stuff in a reasonable time-frame especially when you got looted, despite having men on guard, every odd night. \\n\\nThe exchange rates on items are downright extortionate as even cigarettes, advertised as being needed badly by the army, are worth little to nothing if you just want a bit of metal to build the 30 metal upgrade for your workbench. If you carried nothing but metal with your best scavenger you can manage 60 in a night but often you won\\'t find that much and you need around 20 wood for the upgrade too which can only stack in twos. You need food every day because everyone is hungry every day, fair enough, but you need your water which costs metal for filtration and you need to burn your wood or metal to make fuel to cook one meal for one person!\\n\\nWhat I also noticed was that survivors do not sleep on their own if you skip the day, if you get your fourth survivor and only have a couple of beds, which can work if you alternate, then you will need to sit and watch your survivors stand still or sleep until they wake up in order to swap people into the bed. Why do I have to do that? I\\'m not building anything, nothing is happening, I don\\'t want to sit and wait until this other guy wakes up so I can put the other to bed. \\n\\nIt\\'s so frustrating and not in a difficult sense, you\\'re just a clown juggling things until you see what you drop first. I didn\\'t feel much sense of adventure despite the NPCs I encountered and nobody is willing to do you any favours. Why couldn\\'t they have added some quests or something? A favour for a favour; I only had one instance of this where a guy wanted me to open a door...the way I was going. I opened it, he let me have a few items and that was that, I never saw anything else like that apart from kids at the door going \"help our mother\" where they just keep taking your medication or food. I\\'d rather persistent quests instead of all this bartering where I\\'m stealing goods, selling them back to people, buying other goods that are a pain to find and so on. \\n\\nAlso why can\\'t I take someone with me to scavenge? Why do I keep meeting groups of thugs, bandits, survivors, out on location doing the same thing as me but I can only take one person? It just prolongs something that doesn\\'t need to be there and isn\\'t fun. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\nEat, Sleep, Take All, Repeat.  \\n\\n\\nNo way to \\'befriend\\' other survivors. In one instance I was seen at the front door of another\\'s base and a guy ran out and stabbed me as protection! \\'Thankfully\\' he only stabbed me a few times and let me go so consider that \\'warning\\' heard loud and clear. I thought this game was meant to show the realities of war or something? Since when do people stab you and consider it a warning, why didn\\'t he just wave the knife around and tell me to bugger off? I came across another guy who was having a real hard time, mourning the death of his friend. \"Don\\'t mind me, I\\'m just paying my respects\" or some such he said- right, can I talk to him? No. Maybe I would\\'ve liked to invite this poor sap over to our house seeing as I\\'m meant to feel sympathy for the poor bastard whose friend died and was fittingly(?) buried at the back of a gas station.\\n\\nOn the topic of other survivors, I had one come to my front door and trade with me. Now, I\\'d collected some quality tobacco and coffee. The item description says that these things are the hot buns of the market, everyone wants them, they\\'re so valuable in these times of war. I figure I need some metal to make a bed seeing as I built a rainwater filter and that was it for the day. So, I try to get a few of his abundance (30) of metal. Apprantley coffee isn\\'t worth shit because I pretty much had to trade all my coffee and tobacco for barely any metal- I tried to trade for wood instead and got the same result! I traded anyway, I wanted another bed up; but then the survivor, who was just complaining about having no bed, is now crying we have no tobacco- I\\'ve never seen him smoke! Give me a break. For a game that gets praise for being some emotional experience there\\'s certainly a lack of emotional interaction, my survivors never nattered to each other and only spoke to themselves randomly saying things such as \"We\\'re going to make it\" or \"I would love to sleep in a bed\". Consider me provoked. \\n\\nSurvivors spend most of their time sick or wounded and, at times, you can\\'t do anything about it. \"Bruno needs bandages\" from around the start and there\\'s none to be seen. I never once came across a medical supply apart from herbal medicine and Bruno simply died along with my scavenger who sure learnt his lesson about coming to the front door. \\n\\nThe crafting is so frustrating seeing as you can only get so much a night which usually amounts to one or two objects, and even then you need more to use them. For example, rainwater needs a filter, you need filtered rainwater to cook a meal (5 for one meal, you get 4 per collection and filters cost a few metal as well as being one-time use). There\\'s not much else to the game, it just felt really repetitive where I\\'m putting people to bed or making them eat a meal. Then, after that exciting task, I go to the night and scavenge which is simply clicking on a hand icon and hitting \\'take all\\'. Sometimes, maybe pretty frequently, you\\'ll come back to have been raided. Either your shit is gone, your people got smacked hard defending it, or maybe a combination of the two!\\n\\nIt\\'s just not fun. There\\'s some initial grip to it where you\\'re excited to be surviving in these times of war but God does it drag on. Why survivors start wounded and sick is beyond me, and if you get RNG\\'d on your loot then the game is pretty much done for you. There\\'s no actual relationships developing and your survivors just exist together in the plainest sense, a house of individuals with a shared inventory. There\\'s a much better game out there like this, except with a zombie theme, called Zafehouse. You\\'d think I\\'d have the same criticisms of Zafehouse as I do This War of Mine but it\\'s considerably cheaper and less empty in a more general sense, it was just fun. This game just made me want to go and play that instead, where I actually had a fun time. I\\'d recommended giving Zafehouse a look before This War of Mine.',\n",

       " \"If you do plan on buying this game regardless, for a better experience try pressing escape on your keyboard instead of exit on the in-game menu. Most of my crashes were caused by pressing that. Now, onto the review.\\n\\ntl;dr: This is a really neat experience, but the stability issues, a few bugs, and the god-awful combat system just brings the entire game down so much that it just wasn't enjoyable for me.\\n\\nWhat it does right: I really love what they're going for here. A look into the life of what happens around war instead of just playing the soldiers fighting in it is something I've never seen a game do before. You get to experience having to make extremely hard choices just to maybe have enough supplies to live through the next through days. This game really makes you think hard about what you're willing to do to scrape by. Resources are extremely scarce; I found myself thinking I had enough of one thing just to run out of it the next day. Overall it does a great job of immersing you in the situation and putting you up to difficult decisions, like stealing from or just outright murdering innocents just to be able to survive, or going up against heavily armed thugs or soldiers to maybe see if they've got something you desperately need.\\n\\nIt also keeps things simple, so you don't have to spend ages learning the mechanics of the game, but also isn't so simple that there's no level of complexity you have to adapt to just to be able get what you need through higher level crafting and trading. It's accessible enough to not push you away in the beginning, but has enough depth to make sure you're still struggling to  the end, and in this case it works really well.\\n\\nWhat it does wrong: Despite the really enjoyable core mechanics, some things really break this game for me. For starters, the stability is awful. It took me a couple of hours just to get this game into a semi-playable state, as I had to look up multiple fixes that didn't even work, and play through multiple crashes and freezes until I could identify the main problem and try to work around it. Even  then the game would freeze up on the scavenging screen ocassionally, and it still had the chance of crashing on menus that I couldn't exit out of like I mentioned above. \\n\\nThe crashing wouldn't be as much of a problem if you could save more often, but the game only saves after a full day and night of scavenging, meaning that if you crash at any point during, you have to play that ENTIRE day over again. Needless to say, it can get pretty frustrating if you've done a lot to your house or got pretty far in scavenging that day.\\n\\nSpeaking of infuriating bugs, on the very last night I had a bandit phase through two floors and immediately spot me. I don't mean he just ran up to me... no, he literally passed through the floors in a straight line to see me. This really just soured the entire experience at the very end and completely broke any solid immersion I had. This is an eight month old game that is a full retail release. I could forgive it if it was early access, but things like this and the constant crashing are really unacceptable. \\n\\nThis goes onto my next point of the awful combat. If you can, just avoid it completely. It seems entirely random if you or your opponent dies or not, especially if it involves guns. I've had characters just stand straight up from cover before and stop shooting just to get shot to death. The simplistic system that worked so well for everything else makes the combat absolutely awful in just about every circumstance. The only saving grace is leading them into an instant backstab from a hiding place, but like I said in my last paragraph, even this could lead to a frustrating experience.\\n\\nAfter everything is said and done and I've completed the game, I could probably forgive the combat and give this game a positive review, but the sorry state of the game's stability and bugs make it an unenjoyable experience. If you have the patience of a saint and want a really good and different experience, you should definitely buy this game. Otherwise you'd probably be better off waiting until the devs can actually fix everything before you spend your money on this.\",\n",

And how every decision affects people around you in some way makes you think every time what is the right or the wrong thing to do (which isn`t really a question as you will see further below). But (and that is a big one): In the end that all does not work out. For a game like this, which wants to catch the cold and threatening atmosphere of a shelled city, atmosphere is crucial and so is the music. It should be tense and kind of pulling you down. But instead is it more like someone is playing nice quiet tunes at a campfire. So for me the atmosphere just does not fit the setting, which is a big con to me. In addition, the game mechanics are repetitive and too simple. Watching a character ditching for the 20th time for a minute is just not exiting. Another  thing I disliked, was the attitude of the characters you play. No matter what you do, the other chracters are pissed off because of your actions. For example even though they were starving and you brought food by stealing it, they will be mad at you anyway. They all seem to be noble selfless knights, with no will to survive what so ever. Of course some people are like that, but war is about survival and sometimes you have to do things that are not nice to survive. It would have made the game experience way better if the gameplay represented that. It would also have been interesting if chracters in your group had different opinions on that, so conflicts between them may arise. But they are always personalisations of higher morals.

Both of those games are also side scrollers, I’m pretty sure a Dev or two for this game pulled ideas from those two and or others to make this one.\\n\\nOther reviews say the graphics are good for this game, but Deadlights is much better in my opinion for a post apoc game and it came out years ago and Deadlight has more scenes/scenarios while this game is confined to destroyed buildings.\\n\\n \\n****Spoiler warning*****\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHere’s a list of things I came across while playing this game that are head scratchers or just don’t make any sense.\\n\\nThe survivors know how to make a radio, but no one has the skills to make crude weapons to defend themselves from early raids while you are cleaning out your shelter. The survivors need to collect materials to make a workshop to make crude weapons. Soooo the survivors have the skills to make a workshop, but can’t make simple crude weapons until they can build a workshop. Wait..What?\\n\\nAll the survivors start out with nothing but their empty backpacks. Hmmm\\n\\nI guess the player is supposed to assume either all of your survivors were caught off guard by an attack somewhere else, but they only managed to grab their “empty” backpacks or all your survivors were caught by bandits as a group and all their belongings were taken nearby, though the bandits let them go free until they reached the shelter. But this conflicts with an early first encounter.\\n\\nA First early encounter at the shelter immediately followed with a groan from me. A Knock on door asking for help to carry an injured person home from being shot by a sniper. Sorry to hear that, but no I can’t help you at this time, I don’t know you and this could be a trap.\\n\\nOhh but wait, after you decline to help you’re told this was your “neighbor”. Oook, how did I the player know you were my neighbor? But wait, didn’t you as the survivors just find this place as a shelter? How is this person your neighbor if you just arrived with not even so much as a 2x4, knife or scrap of food on any of you? ugh\\n\\nObservation - During play, no survivor is strong enough to lift a table/chair or knock over a damaged wooden dresser and smash it to the ground for wood/fuel, they must craft an axe to break things down to collect wood/fuel.\\n\\nObservation-When scavenging, you can commonly find rare items like lock picks but more common items like hammers, knives(even a common butter knife that could be used as a weapon) are nowhere to be found. It also appears every radio and alarm clock has been destroyed during the war and one must be made, since you can’t even trade for one, though parts for one can be found.\\n\\nObservation-How is it that every occupied area around you has people with guns, but everyone in your group is bare handed with not so much as a shiv/knife or a 2x4 when they start.\\n\\nItems like crowbars break down after repeated use on wooden doors in destroyed buildings. What? I could understand a shovel breaking because of a wooden handle, but a crowbar? Saws are also a one-time use item. wow\\n\\nObservation- With Ai NPCs, if they have guns It’s always shoot on sight if you try to scavenge a new area with people there. There’s no “hey who are you, get out of here or I’ll shoot” “It’s hey someone’s there, you’re dead” BANG BANG\\n\\nNo chance for “Oh, sorry I was not aware this area was already occupied, I’m leaving”\\n\\nObservation-How is it possible for an NPC to know you stole something from them if you show up with a different character than the one used to steal? Silly\\n\\nWhy does snow that you collect at your front door need to be melted/purified at your cooking stove when you have a wood heater that is heating your shelter?\\n\\nThe survivors can only send out one scavenger per night no matter how many survivors you have and you can scavenge only one place per night even if you are done scavenging in a short time. If you clean out an area in an hour, you’re done for the rest of the night since you’re confined to that building/area all night. No other areas close buy/next door can be scavenged until the next night even if you have 4 hours to spare, you have to end the night or basically twiddle your thumb for X amount of hours until it’s time to go home.\\n\\nThe game tries to get you to open your shelter up to more survivors for you to manage/take care of beyond your initial starting group. But there is no point in doing so from a survival standpoint unless you want to read their profile/back story. When I became self-sufficient, food was still scarce/hard to come by with just 3 people. Adding more survivors only puts you in a worse position and there is nothing for the extra survivors to do but sit around, always be cold/hungry/tired or get wounded in a raid. If you could actually use the extra survivors to go scavenging, I could see the point in adding them to your shelter.\\n\\nThe survivors can’t go out in the daytime, there appears to be a 24 hour curfew. So for a war that’s been going on for years, there are no temporary trade markets during the day to trade at. Strangely you hear on the radio there are supplies like coffee being dropped off, so why are none of the survivors allowed to leave during the day to get some of this humanitarian aid?\\n\\nIn game time goes by in 10 minute increments, with each increment occurring in less than 10 seconds, somewhere around 8 seconds. So if you do have stuff to do, you need to do it quickly before 8pm. The problem with that is that it takes one of your characters 30 game minutes to walk up 1 flight of stairs or go from one floor of your shelter to another. So if you want to go up 3 stories in your shelter to build/make/break something, it will take you 1 and a half game hours to walk up those stairs. This does not include time to actuallty build/break your item. Crazy stuff.\\n\\nI completed the game in 42 days without killing anyone simply by concentrating on becoming self-sufficient, there’s no need to kill any NPCs unless that is what you want to do or risk. The worst thing I did was steal some supplies from the old couple.\\n\\nWhile the message the game is trying to send is a good one and the charity part is appreciated, the actual game play is unrealistic and is incredibly repetitive after about day 20. It would be even more so if the crime wave did not occur to mix things up after day 10. Don’t be lured in by the massive amount of recommends and wait for a sale, the $20 is too high for the limited amount of content provided.',\n",
       " 'Okay.... I am trying to take a deep breath and calm myself before I write the review...\\n\\nHere is the truth.  I LOVED this game, so why would I rate it down?  The artistic value of the game is to be revered.  The game-play is fun, addictive like crack, and balanced all the way through.  It is a survival game that makes you care for your characters because with a little extra thought, proper preparation, and a careful use of resources, the game can be the PERFECT challenge all the way through.  Not so much that you put it away from dying all the time, but just enough so you feel that you can learn from your mistakes when you take the wrong person looting and get him/her shot, push too far into a bandits\\' base for loot and  get someone killed, or become a bandit yourself and watch your characters hate themselves for it.  It all works!  So WHY in god\\'s name am I rating this game down.... SIGH.  I will tell you at the end, because the ending is is why I am now jaded.\\n\\nThis game has this unique blend of survival and platformer elements.  The combat is a little wonky, but this is not an action game.  This is a survival game that pushes your moralities to the limit: do you send off one of your characters for a day to help your neighbors who in the past have shown you kindness, or do you turn your back and keep to yourself so you can keep your base safe while looting?  Killing is not taken lightly in this game.  Most of the characters are not fighters.  They have never shot at anyone before and you must weigh how stressful it will be on them to out-right murder a person for his/her loot.  sometimes it might be best to come back from a night of looting with a bag half full and a heart that is not broken.\\n\\nThe characters themselves are all full of life and special in their own way.  One or two are trained in combat, and do not feel the pressure of killing so long as they  are not killing innocents.  Some are good cooks, others are handy-men that  use less resources to build and craft with.  Others can keep children calm and tend to wounded while others are small but stealthy, making them ideal for nightly looting runs\\n\\nLooting is done so well.  Your characters feel no pain from looting bandits, but question themselves for steeling from an elderly family.  The stealth mechanics are solid and intense at many times.  I managed a play-through without ever shooting at anyone. (apart from defending my base from bandits.  Can\\'t be controlled and it doesn\\'t affect your characters depression)  I chose to help all  who asked of it, but stole when I needed to as long as I did not leave someone for dead by doing so, and yes there is a difference between taking what you need in this game, and taking everything, and your character will reflect on that.  Limited backpack space and time turn scavenging into a strategic race for time as you decide whether or not to bring a crowbar and lock-pick, or save the space and only take what loot is easily accessible while scouting out threats, bared and locked doors and piles of obstructing rubble that can be cleared on a succeeding night.  Rubble that can be moved without a shovel,  but will take a lot of your precious time if you chose to do so.\\n\\nKeeping your team rested and fed feels just right, and the amount of given resources is remarkable.  Too big of a team means that more food will be needed than can be provided.  Too small and your base will be raided while you are out looting and sleeping.  Choosing who sleeps at night, who sleeps on a bed or off a bed, and who sleeps during the day can\\'t be taken lightly.  Wounded characters will take rest, first-aid, and time to heal.  A few nights passed that I had to keep everyone at the base and be frugal for a day so the group could recover.\\n\\nThe bartering system is well thought out.  There is a traveling tradesman that will show up every few days with goods that can be exchanged for home made moon-shine, home grown vegies, looted and self-made meds and anything else you want to trade.  You can also take specific items with you on  \"looting\"  runs to trade with the military, other survivors and even bandits.  Each group seeks different items, and you are not likely to come home with a full backpack, but you will have exactly what you set out for, and some times that is more important.\\n\\nThere is also a winter that you must survive.  OMG was it intense.  Keeping enough fire wood burning to keep your characters healthy while still having enough to cook food and craft pushed me to the limit more than once.  I was taking an ax to furniture just to keep the fires going.  Brilliant!  The winter is not too long and comes on at a nice pace so that you have time to trade for or scavenge what is needed in time build a heater for your base. (hint: UPGRADE IT EMEDIATELY!)\\n\\nAnd lastly, the DLC for this game is heart warming to say the least.  It doesn\\'t add much content to the game, but %100 of the proceeds goes to the War Child charity, and that\\'s just groovy.  The dlc adds some wall-art to the in-game levels.\\n\\nNow... After so much praise, why did I rate this game down?!\\n\\n[b]Small spoilers ahead[/b]\\n\\nI WILL TELL YOU WHY!\\n\\nI worked my tail off keeping my crew alive!  I helped EVERYONE that asked of it.  I killed no one, and only stole when I was desperate, and even then I took only what I needed and never left anyone to die.  I brought in a character in need when he asked and he survived with the rest of us to the end....  THE END!\\n\\nThe war lasts 45 days max, some people don\\'t like this, I don\\'t mind it so much.  It can end some time before that, but its random.  If you have built a radio, it will keep you informed of whats going on.  INCLUDING THE WEATHER!\\n\\nDay 44 roles around.  I have mastered my team and have prevailed through dozens of bandit attacks, and winter included.  I have an outright stock pile of weapons, ammo, food, supplies, crafting tables, trade goods, and FIRE WOOD.  The forecast from the radio, which you will see in the screen shot, called for \"warm days ahead.\"  Winter was about a week in the past at this point and there is only one winter in this damn game!\\n\\nI leave my base on the 44th night to do some light looting because I wanted to pass the time and grab some last minute stuff in the case that there is some end game fight or something.  I leave with  \"WARM DAYS\"  in the forecast and a thermostat that reads 20 Celsius.  That is hot for this game, it starts around 15 C.  I get back to -5 C and a team that has frozen to death........... What in the flying F**K is that crap?!?!\\n\\n*edit* Turns out this is a bug that the devs have not felt inclined to fix.  With this knowledge, I will keep the thumbs down rating.  The bug is heart breaking and a game changer that happens at the very end of the game.  I am not a programer, but this cannot be the toughest bug to fix.  The day this bug is remedied is the day I give this game a thumbs up\\n\\nThis is why I cannot rate this game up.\\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/screenshot/436072840510605697\\n\\nNote: day 39 calls for cool weather.  \"Cool\" weather shows up as predicted on days 40, 41, 42.  The temp goes down a bit during the day time, and I stoke the woodstove.\\n\\nNote: day 42 calls for warm weather, as well as day 45: it drops below freezing on night 44 after nothing but rising temperatures during the day and kills my team.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m going to have to join the minority here and say that I rather disliked the game overall.\\n\\nStorywise, I found it very underwhelming compared to what was advertised.  The game simply does not provide an atmosphere that is conducive for the player to form emotional attachments to the characters - we see very little character development aside from a handful of short text blurbs.  In-game interactions are fairly basic - they feel hungry when not fed, get sick when they are cold, feel tired when they do not sleep, and become depressed when they commit murder (oddly, as far as I remember, characters do not have a similar reaction when stealing from innocents).  After the novelty of the game wears off, these interactions tend to feel sterile, reptitive, and predictable.\\nIn essence, the player never really gets to know the characters, and as a result there is nowhere for the advertised empathy to take root.  I still feel like I\\'m playing a video game, rather than interacting with a game universe - ie, I would not feel bad when I have Boris murder a handful of people in cold blood for their loot, because those \"people\" are faceless NPCs who do not have moral value.  Boris will feel depressed afterwards, but \"depression\" is something that can be cured with a couple clicks and some time, and he\\'ll be right back to the status quo within a night or two and ready to kill faceless NPCs again.  And this cycle repeats endlessly until the end of the war, with the only long-term consequence being a different blurb of text at the end of the game (characters get better or worse epilogues depending on whether you have them spend time being nice to people or murdering them).\\nOccasionally, the game will attempt to give an NPC a face (many of the non-faceless NPCs are already dead by the time you arrive on the scene), but the interactions in the game are always too short and non-interactive to provide much of an impact.  Why should I care about the life of that person in the semi-abandoned house?  She\\'s shooting at me, video game logic dictates that I kill her.  That is the sum of her character, and that does not change simply because another NPC runs over and starts crying over her corpse.  Am I supposed to care simply because I see an animation that resembles someone feeling sad?  As far as I remember, she isn\\'t even given a name, ingame (she is named on the wiki, though).  Both she and the helpless civilian mourning her death lack the complexity needed to provoke a thoughtful or sympathetic reaction from the player.  They don\\'t feel like they\\'re actual people, especially after you\\'ve seen the exact same scene multiple times.\\n\\nI also find that the emotional impact gets buried under the slow and reptitive gameplay.  I found that, at first, I was too busy trying to learn the game and survive to care much about the NPCs I encountered (\"oh, there\\'s a man caring for his elderly parents... hey, look, duct tape!  Exactly what I needed to progress through the game!\").  By the time I learned the game, it felt routine enough that stealing from and killing the NPCs was simply part of a game (\"What, you\\'re caring for your elderly parents?  Meh, seen it 27 times.  Hand over the carrots.\").\\nSimilarly, as I got more familiar with the game, the limited AI in the game made many of the NPCs less believable.  Logically, if I walk into the military base with an assault rifle, a hatchet, and heavy body armor and blow/chop the heads off half the soldiers stationed at the facility (not hard to do once you\\'ve learned the levels and the combat mechanics), and then retreat into the night before the timer reaches daylight, the remaining soldiers SHOULD have some sort of reaction by the time I return the next night.  But no, they don\\'t even alter their patrols.  They keep walking in the same patterns as they always did, completely ignoring the murder of their comrades and the gaping hole in their front gate\\'s defenses.\\n\\nI also find it rather unsatisfying how little we\\'re told about the war itself.  We know that there\\'s a war, and it\\'s bad for the civilians (like any war), and this is somehow supposed to be enough.  It isn\\'t enough, because it doesn\\'t feel believable and it\\'s not an engaging story.  Why is this war being fought?  Who is fighting it, and what do they stand for?  The game rarely gives the player relevant information about what\\'s going on, even when doing so would greatly help the immersion of the game (for instance, if you visit the rebel-occupied school, why don\\'t the rebels take the opportunity to give you some propaganda pamphlets to read?  Why doesn\\'t the government try to drum up patriotism if you visit the military base?).  \\nAre these rebels revolutionary freedom fighters overthrowing an oppressive government, or are they reactionary terrorists?  The message of the game seems to be that it does not matter, and we should focus on the plight of noncombatants because feelings.  Such a sentiment can only preserve the status quo (as wars happen because of attempts to disrupt the status quo), which may well do more long-term harm to the civilians than the war - we don\\'t know, because we aren\\'t told what the status quo is or why the war is being fought.  Maybe the pre-war government was democratic and defend human rights, or maybe it was tyrannical and oppressive.  Maybe the rebels are really trying to help the people, or maybe they\\'re bloodthirsty thugs trying to instill fear.  Maybe neither side is so clear-cut.  Instead of developing this interesting storyline, the game chooses to focus on meaningless appeals to emotion which usually don\\'t stir up the intended emotion and over-dramatic short stories that usually come across as pieces of a story rather than a finished story.  For example, why should we care whether Katia publishes her journal or burns it?  We never knew her in the first place.  We don\\'t even know most of what\\'s going into the journal.  \"She\" was never anything more than a photograph and a few sentences of text, and these were not enough to create an emotional connection between her and the player.\\nIt is almost as if the entire point of the game was to anviliciously try to portray war as fundamentally pointless and gruesome and assert that the only meaningful things are the lives that are damaged by it, but the game fails in demonstrating these because the pointlessness is only brought about by mediocre storytelling and the gruesomeness isn\\'t adequately conveyed in-game, and nor do the lives feel meaningful.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s an ok game, in terms of gameplay, but gets old fairly quickly.  The days in particular often have periods in which you are not doing anything but waiting for something to happen or be built - this is especially the case if you\\'re new to the game and don\\'t have a specific plan laid out in advance with regards to what you need to do and what you need to do it.  Gathering enough resources, particularly food, is difficult at first (especially if you want to survive without stealing), but it gets easier over time. and scavenging quickly starts to feel dull and reptitive.  It\\'s also not particularly difficult once you get rolling - if you\\'re efficient about your looting and resource management, you\\'ll probably have enough resources to go around for most of the game.  Combat is difficult at first, but becomes much easier once you learn the mechanics and even easier once you loot some high-quality gear (the key is to have someone good in melee combat use a hiding place and stab someone in the back with a knife or hatchet as they\\'re walking by.  If they have allies, they\\'ll sprint towards the scene, but you can usually step right back into the hiding place and do the exact same thing with them too.  The NPCs are stupid enough that these kinds of tactics can be used to clear out entire areas, with the only real danger coming from situations in which you\\'re either caught unprepared or have to fight multiple NPCs at once.).',\n",
       " \"Great game, but I can't commit the amount of time to such a peradeath game.

This game is fantastic for a teenager who has the whole summer to spend doing nothing, with no responsibilies and no where to go.  For everyone else, i would say just stay away it'll suck up tremendous amounts of time and you won't realize it untill it's 1AM.\",\n",

       " \"Great theme doesn't save this game.\\n\\nThematically this game works really well and I feel that this has led people to ignore that as a game it in fact fails in most areas. It goes without saying the theme to this game is 10/10. It really achieves what it set out and that theme does a lot to bring a tension to this game.\\n\\nYet the controls are awful, combat is a mess and the poorly executed roguelike elements renders this game an exercise in frustration. \\n\\nWith Characters being one shot killed at times, controlling things through sketchy clicking and relying on autopathing is just skirting with disaster all the time. Imagine playing any stealth game with just a mouse and you will get the idea. It often feels like a quick reflex game with no way to actually use your reflexs because the controls are just terrible. Point and click stealth action in a permadeath environment is awful. \\n\\nCombat is just as bad, melee is click on enemy and watch your character swing hoping you kill them before they kill you. Stealth kills are I guess okay just the same click with a different icon. Ranged weapons are a disaster, attempt to get behind cover in the most finicky clicking possible and then shoot by clicking. The whole time you will wish you were able to do this with a keyboard. \\n\\nAvoiding the stealth and combat is quite difficult. Crafting barely turns a profit from raw materials (You can just barely buy back the raw goods from selling the end product) and relies on you scavenging the materials. This leads to the economy of the game being pretty unrealistic and in many ways removes the peaceful option (though it is mostly possible it becomes vastly more effort than other strategies). In what world is a bottle of moonshine about as valuable than the water and sugar it took to make, especially during a severe war. Rolled cigarettes are about as valuable as raw tobacco. \\n\\nThe economy of this game is entirely unrealistic due to being made arbitarily difficult. Buying guns and ammo is not difficult mid game but want a hatchet though and you are often completely out of luck. A shovel for sale is rarer than a gun in this game. A metal workshop is easier to make than a vegetable garden. Rolling a cigarette is more difficult than making a radio. At the start building a bed is fine but boarding up a window take upgrades. Also bandages take pure alcohol to make...  In short the theme and immersion of this game is thrown out the window and replaced with nonsensical rules to create a difficulty that feels incredibly artificial. It's a disaster.\\n\\nThere is very little roguelike execution. Levels are the same with some having NPC variation. Now unless you are using a guide you will be seeing those areas again and again so the pain of losing is enormous. Also the places that appear each game change the difficulty dramatically, which is a poor execution. \\n\\nThis game is actually bad.

       " \"I bought this due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews but failed to see the appeal. My main criticism is that the game is very slow paced and a far too unforgiving. Its highly repetitive after the first few days, and despite my every effort, all of my housemates were constantly sick for no obvious reason, and all starved within about 15 turns. Once I got about this far in the game, raids became so frequent (despite reinforcing my house twice and having someone on guard every night) that my characters' deaths became inevitable and I was able to see inevitability this many turns in advance.\\n\\nI wouldnt be so bad if you could scavange more than one place a night or dispatch more than one person to scavenge (like you could in reality). Multiple times I would arrive to scavenge an area, and either not have the tools I needed to get through a door or immediately meet an adversary with a gun. In these scenarios I was forced to turn back immediately, thereby wasting my night of scavenging and making everyone in my house hungrier. This was ultimately my downfall, because it left me with not even supplies I needed to barter with for food once I returned without food virtually every day. Food is also very costly to trade for and rare in general. \\n\\nI understand that you're supposed to feel the stress of the scenario, but I didnt even get to survive long enough to unlock all of the equipment you could build or explore half of the areas available. This was all despite my most diligent attempts to succeed from the beginning. If the games are randomly generated, berhaps I met with a very dificult one on my first play through, but I had no way of knowing this in advance that I knew of. The whole experience was mostly tedious, bland and unfulfilling.\",\n",
       " 'Pretty well made game, game mechanics work well for the most part. Art work is strong and noticeable, using a pencil sketching style, but the reason for not recommending this game is because I simply didn\\'t enjoy it. I don\\'t care for survival games too much, but tried this out at the recommendation of a friend. Despite not caring much for the genre I trucked through and did complete a single \"story\" and survived until day 23 :)\\n\\nThis War of Mine is played as a small group of survivors living in a large house. Each night 1 survivor may leave to search for goods while the others stay and sleep or guard the house. Your house has many utilities you can build- a small garden, a heater, rat trap for food, a stove, etc. You use these utilities and workstations to craft goods you\\'ll need to survive. While you can eat raw food, cooked food does much better for filling you up. You\\'ll need to board up your house where, I would assume, collateral damage from the war has created large gaps in the walls and windows. Both your day cycle to build items, harvest goods, and interact with other survivors, traders, etc, and your night cycle to find new goods, are timed with a clock in the top left corner.\\n\\nYour survivors each have a different skill set. I got Bruno, Pavle, and Katia as my starting three. Bruno is a good cook who can create food using fewer resources. Pavle runs fast so he can avoid danger or run from it while scavenging. Katia is a good bargainer so she can squeeze more out of your trade deals. Later on I got Cveta and Arika with \"Good with children\" and \"Sneaks quietly\" skills, respectively. I saw in the build your own game section there are quite a few survivors, all with their different skill sets.\\n\\nThe scavenging is done only during the night and if you don\\'t manage to exit voluntarily before the night ends, then your character gets \"caught out\" and will have a delay before he and his scavenged goods return. To scavenge you first pick who will go, then where. The where is very important as each area has certain resources- building materials, weapons parts, food, traders, and even danger! (Gasp!) Revisiting some areas will show development of the region with new people taking over or previously present people disappearing. Scavenging is as simple as clicking on highlighted rubble, desks, drawers, cabinets, etc, and after a moment to inspect the spot, you get an inventory screen showing what you have and what you can take.\\n\\nWar is hell. I knew this well before playing this game and I\\'m strongly against coercive force and am a supporter of the non-aggression principle. I like to role play and empathize with the characters I\\'m playing as, whether it\\'s Mass Effect, Deponia, or Civilization 5. I made the decision early on I would help anyone I could and wouldn\\'t harm another person. I knew somewhere in the \"teens\" days I wouldn\\'t make it far and I was ok with it. Trading couldn\\'t get me enough food or bandages, bandits hit the home every single night, and I couldn\\'t scavenge everything needed. I stole from armed bandits a few times, very carefully, and thanked the Lord for Pavle\\'s large inventory space and his fast running. In the end, we just didn\\'t make it.\\n\\nIf you\\'re into survival games, and the life and death aspects of it, then pick this up. It has an amazing human element to it and I think was extremely realistic in how it handled the precious few resources available and the decisions on how to use them. All in all, bottom line is I would not freely recommend this game to a friend. It has a niche audience and isn\\'t fun. It\\'s challenging and engaging, but this means it\\'s not for everyone.',\n",

The gui needs some work, it turns all your numbers to orange if you have some kind of surplus, but it won't change at all if you need certain item like materials or components. \\n\\nThe game crashed the first time I launched it, and it also crashes if I'm playing in full screen and want to alt tab to open my browser or just to pull out the notepad.\",\n",

       " 'review': 'I really wanted to enjoy Necropolis. The idea of a Roguelite with Dark Souls-like combat sounded really enticing. Unfortunately the game does not live up to that hope. At it\\'s core it has the possibility to be a great game. Maybe even one of the best Roguelikes out there.  At the moment though, the game is horribly unfinished and not worthy of the $30 price tag. There is only one type of class; a sword n\\' board playstyle that can get dull quickly. It doesn\\'t help that there are only like four different weapon types, all of which don\\'t have much significant differences in playstyle. The combat  and animations also feel floaty and unsatisfying. Along with that the weapons feel like foam swords because higher level enemies absorb a ridiculous amount of damage before dying. Speaking of enemies, there are only a handful of types with higher level ones just having more health. Just like the enemies, the nine levels that the game offers all horribly dull too. I understand that the levels will not be as complex as similar games due to it\\'s procedural generation, but the rooms themselves are all horrendously bland and uninteresting. I personally love the style of this game, but it definetly does not help the rooms look any less dull. Admitedly I have not played the Co-op. I assume that the multiplayer aspect of the game would make it more enjoyable, but that is the same with any game. [b]To wrap it up, the game feels like it is in early access. It still has the opportunity to be good, but at the moment it is not worth the price tag. Wait for it to go on sale or for the developers to fix it and add more content.[/b]\\n\\nAlthough I am no developer, as someone who has played the game I have some suggestions on how to \"fix\" the game.\\n\\n-Qualty of life features: Goes without saying, but this game needs simple things like keybindings, gameplay options, and little stuff like being able to craft multiple items at once. These are things that are just expected of any game.\\n\\n-Tweak and tighten up the combat: As the core gameplay loop the combat has to be perfect if they want to make sure players don\\'t get sick of it after a couple hours of playing.  Right now the game feels too slow which is odd because the player moves fast, but when he attacks he looks like he is wading through mollasses. Along with the inability to cancel attacks, this makes the combat slow and frustrating. The animations have a lot to do with it. Through winding up the attack to actually hitting something your swing speeds remains the same. Along with that, don\\'t make later enemies as bullet-spongy. Of course, them being tougher is a neccesity, and you should make them have more hp than the weaker enemies, but the basis of their difficulty should be based of their ai and attacks. Make their attacks more difficult to dodge, more interesting. Also make them more competent fighters to be more of a challenge. As would be expected, look at the souls series as a good example of these suggestions.\\n\\n-Loot is boring and the thousands of weapons that drop are annoying. Sure, it is kinda interesting that all enemies drop their weapons, but they are so annoying when you are trying to pick something up from the floor when it is littered with a bunch of rusty swords. Just give the option of a loot menu for a radius of enemies. A simple quality of life improvment like this would improve the game a lot. When it comes to the loot itself, it is bland. All weapons types share an almost identicle moveset and tiers of weapons usually just mean a bit more damage. Like any proper dungeon crawler, their should be variations, rarity, and unique weapons that can be found or even made. I would remove tiers entirely from the game. Make all weapons equally viable, personal choice and your character build determine what weapon you use. Again, similar to Dark Souls. A nice touch would also give more types of attacks to different weapons like running attacks, rolling attacks, two handed/alt form, etc.\\n\\n-Either enhance crafting or remove it entirely: Right now crafting feels more like a hindrance to this game more than anything. It is so underdeveloped and makes the game too easy. I almost always have an overabundance of crafting items and can easily create more healing items than I would ever need. Most of the bombs and other items you can create are useless too. If you don\\'t feel like taking the time needed to fix the system just modify drop rates of other items and remove crafting entirely. If you want to fix it you need to expand it and balance it. Firstly I feel like you shouldn\\'t be able to craft everythign wherever you want. It removes inventory managment entirely when you have infinite storage space for crafting reagents. Between levels or randomly placed throughout the level there should be different types of crafting stations for different types of items. Cooking station for food, enchanting table for crafting scrolls and potions, and a smith for creating and modifying weapons. As I stated earlier, make all weapons equal and let the player imrpove them how they see fit. Let them take apart weapons and upgrade their own with different features, like special properties or simple changes like faster attack speed for weaker damage. Since I already have written a huge wall of text I will leave this part here.\\n\\n-Multiple playstyles and character choices. Goes without saying, give starting classes. Knight, rogue, wizard, healer, summoner, etc. It adds replayability to the game. Along with that give internal and external run progression. As it is right now, there is almost no reason to spend tokens within a run besides opening a little chest. Make it a balancing act for the player between saving up tokens for long term rewards or upgrading your character now to ensure that they can actually beat the run and get the rewards for doing so. Essentially the tokens are the souls of the game. Between levels you use them to upgrade your character. More health, better with certain weapons, more stamina, etc. Of course, you can just not level up but you risk losing the run and like in a souls game you lose the tokens on death. If you make it to the level you died on you get them back. Another option is for you to play it safe and store your tokens at a 2 for 1 rate. The tokens will be stored at the start of the game and you can pull them out when you wish to. Your incentive for not spending them is that you can use them for permanent upgrades to all your runs. You know, the typical roguelite stuff. New classes, new levels, new loot, etc. Just because it could be hard for certain players to consistently beat runs to upgrade their game. This can be done at the  triangle god at the beginning of the dungeon. \\n\\nI have already gone on long enough so I will abbreviate a couple more suggestions.\\n\\n-Level bosses + legendary enemies that drop special loot.\\n\\n-More interesting levels\\n\\n-\"Soapstone\" co-op. At the beginning of each level option to join up with random players for a short time.\\n\\n-Invasions and Arena mode. Invade other players for tokens. Arena mode is alternate game mode (like Greed Mode in Issac). Go into duels, if you win get stuff to upgrade character. Keep duelling with other players until you retire or lose a fight.\\n\\nSorry for the rant. I was just really looking forward to this game and was dissapointed by it\\'s mediocrity.',\n",
