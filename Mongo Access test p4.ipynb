There seems to be ZERO point to anything you do as all you will be doing is grinding to become more efficient, so you can grind some more. Add some travelling and you have NMS game play loop in its entirety, and it is all very easy, even when you first start out, because little to nothing will hinder your ability to do the only thing this game really has to offer, GRIND. The only \"challenge\" this game offers is managing your inventory. There is NO risk/reward factor, and the only time you ever really feel good about anything you have done in this game is when you build a sweet base, but that is basically ALL there is, unless you want to explore the overwhelming number of procedurally generated planets. Which I will say can be beautiful and cool looking from time to time, but that sense of beauty and coolness will wear off fast, then your back to the game play loop of grinding just to sight see, and grind some more. This game is entirely too based around being JUST a sandbox, and because of this, you have to make up your own fun too a degree iv never experienced in a game before. Even a game as similar and simple as Minecraft has challenge and reward. Why do non of these updates for NMS address the only real problem this game has suffered from since day 1? Without meaning, without risk, without reward, without challenge, this game is just not entertaining for most people.',\n",

So no new content for me and rewards withheld. Forcing people to play a set way is never a good idea for the masses. And this is a totally a cheap and easy way of putting content in the game.

Absolute nightmare to try and run wires.  Not only is it difficult to run the wires, (they dont snap right), but to power things requires your entire inventory of carbon.  I put in 200 Carbon and powered my base for 3 minutes and i cant turn the generator off and on.  Is cable management really a forced part of the game now?  Why do the plugs not snap right?  How did this make it past QA?\\n\\nThis is NOT fun.  Please allow us to disable the power systems in our own bases.  I am fine that other people may enjoy managing cables.  More power to them (hehe), but for the love of god, test your ideas with casual players too.  I'm sure there are some very dedicated people with amazing work on cable management.  I'm not one of them, and no, i'm not playing on creative.\\n\\nAt least Astroneer's cable system makes sense.  No Mans Sky just duct taped this into their game without considering how annoying it would be for people who dont enjoy working on cable management at data centers.\\n\\nVery disappointed.\",\n",

My pc is never fully utilized, but still drops frames and isn't stable. \\nThe virtual reality portion is even worse. This game in vr has the worst performance I have ever seen in a virtual reality game. It almost always runs at 45 fps in vr which hasn't changed or gotten any better. The game also looks horrible at this performance level even when running at such a bad fps level. Somehow I don't think that they are doing much in the way of optimization for amd hardware, so beware.  \\n\\nOverall, I find that this game is extremely fun, but is confusing at times. It feels like sometimes, objectives are hidden in a way like the developers don't want you to solve the problem you come across, even in the earliest stages. \\nI don't recommend this game, just because of preformance and MY experience, but the fact that the gameplay is fun and unique make it worth it to me\\n6/10\",\n",

That being said; I feel NMS continues to fail at living up to it's pre-launch marketing.Is it better than it was in 2016? Definitely. But that's a low bar. \\n\\nNMS is a mash up of serveral different genre's. It's an RPG, shooter, space exploring, walking simulator. It takes a little bit of gameplay elements from similar games and mashes them up in to a confusing jumble that amounts to a glorified treadmill of a game that doesn't produce as gratifying an experience as other games that focus on one of those elements.\\n\\nQuintillions of planets to explore? You bet and they're mostly re-skinned versions of each other. Awesome ships to buy, trade and customize? Yea and they effectively all do the same things. Want to discover and ride an winged mushroom-bear? You're going to have a hard time finding it among all the swimming cows that seem to inhabit every 5th planet.\\n\\nThe game takes a carrot-on-a-stock approach to make the gameplay loop compelling. Do a chore and unlock the next gadget that you think will finally take you off the treadmill. But that gizmo actually just makes the treadmill a little easier to run on. 100 hours in and you'll still find yourself grinding away and then you realize that if the grind ever stopped that there would be no point.\",\n",

And why can't you party with more than 4 players when it supports up to 32 per server on PC??\\n\\nNOTE: If you've never played before there is a LONG tutorial. You can't really play with friends very easily until you've all made it through enough of the tutorial to reach the anomaly space station.\\n\\nI tried to play with a group of friends over a weekend. We spent an entire Friday night and an entire Saturday trying to learn how to play the game and get to the anomaly, the entire time playing solo (for the most part). After several game crashes and buggy quests (one person could only complete quests playing as the host in their own game), we finally all made it to the anomaly and started a group quest. Upon starting the group quest and setting out on flight to the target planet, one friend's game crashed again and when he logged back in he couldn't join us. We tried to complete the quest 3-player but another's game crashed. With 2-players trying to complete the quest, one (somehow) ended up on a different step of the quest and couldn't proceed. The other was on the correct step (destroy 5 depots), but nothing he did would destroy the depots. He managed to destroy 2 out of 5 depots but the rest were just... invincible? All while being constantly bombarded by sentinels with 5 stars of threat and dying over and over.\\n\\nEven if you're a glutton for punishment and love overly complicated interfaces and tedious crafting, this game is still WAY more frustrating than it's worth IMO. Maybe if you play solo and only group with random strangers online? I don't know.\\n\\nVery disappointing. This game has so much potential. Flying from planet to planet, jumping star system, it all feels so amazing and looks breath-taking. I don't understand how the game is still so buggy and they still can't support larger party sizes. With the amount of bugs/issues we had, I would honestly say this game is near unplayable.\",\n",

(C) is odd because the shipwrecks seem to be identical on every planet I find one. \\n\\nI don't necessarily mind grinding as I play other games that have elements of it. I just don't find some things very germane to my enjoyment. Like hoofing it all over a planet to learn languages one word at a time. Or having basically 3-4 dialogue options for all NPCs. Again, maybe that unlocks after you grind a few hundred hours of running around the planet surfaces but I just can't get motivated to do that. Once you've gotten used to scanning the standard  half dozen things in range of your landing zone, it's just endless repetition. \\n\\nAll that said, I have to give them credit for improving a lot of the things that got them so much crap at release. And generally getting things pretty stable, at least on my PC. Maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did.\",\n",

The PC version runs extremely smooth for me and i usually have no problems with it. Of course i have experienced about 2 crashes beforehand though, but the VR portion of this game is what brings it down for me. The VR experience in No Mans Sky lacks optimization to the extreme, which basically cuts the FPS in half. This ruins the play experience for me, thought im confident that the developers behind No Mans Sky can surely fix this sooner or later',\n",

       "  'review': 'Right now the game is extremely buggy, and i really mean extremely. Though i must say the game has alot of good content and is really addictive. So when or if they actually start caring about bug fixing this game it will be a thumb up. \\nBut at this very moment im pissed enough over all these bugs to write a proper freckin review on here.\\n\\nThe time between finding a new bug is only a few minutes. Some of these bugs are ofc depending on current system and not everyone will experience the exact same bugs that i do. But you will most likely just find other ones instead.\\nIve found new bugs every day ive been playing. Just to give you an idea of the severity ill list a few bugs:\\n\\n1. Game lagged like crazy until i found a way to manipulate the CPU core usage in one of the game files in the game folder.\\n2. A planet with one of my bases changed weather and sentinel status from neutral to aggressive all of a sudden. \\n3. A friend of mine had the game crash every time he died. Which you do alot first hour of play on survival if you are new. Way to steep learning curve for absolutely no reason btw...\\n4. Its common to fall/bounce through floors/walls/floating mountain structures. Both for you and the alien creatures. \\n5. Invisible walls appearing every now and then at places you know there shouldnt be one. Like for instance, when I save and log out when im in my freighter (its like your capital ship), I keep getting locked into rooms or finding invisible walls in the corridors. Several times ive had to rollback to last autosave. Autosave doesnt happen that very often, and in this case its kinda bad having to loose an hour or so of game time. \\n6. Able to sometimes duplicate items when moving items stacks between inventory and storage facilities. \\n7. Terrain manipulation sometimes working, sometimes not. Sometimes it resets instantly, sometimes it gets graphic bugs, sometimes instanly, sometimes you go away for a few minutes and come back to some really weirld looking spikes through the ground.\\n8. Bases does not always keep out weather effects and keep oxygen inside, eventhough they are complete with floor, walls and roof. \\n9. Your base does not tend to look the same to your multiplayer buddy. The game doesnt seem to sync properly with terrain/building parts and parts like trees and stones etc. \\n10. Sometimes after repairing your partly broken frigate (a ship that you can send out on missions for you) and get the \"repair complete\", you can still be able to find other broken parts for some reason. \\n11. Sometimes you cant move items from your storage to your inventory. Unless! You find the tiny pixel on the item icon that still works. Just imagine wanting to start a game or a program from the icon on your Desktop in windows. But it only works clicking the icon if you find 1 pixel on that whole icon. At first you think its completely broken but then you realise its only 99.9999% broken. Such a relief...\\n12. Short distance portals seems to work about 33% of every first time you try it and maybe only one way. After that it usually stops working completely. \\n13. Sometimes when close to an object while flying your space ship, the game seems to think you are stuck to the object and you start taking ship damage eventhugh you\\'re clearly not that close. \\n14. Sometimes you take random damage from or get stuck in ladders. \\n15. Hit boxes on stones or trees and stuff isnt always correct. So when trying to mine it, it doesnt work properly. \\n\\nI think i could go on forever.... I think you get the point. The game is more than broken at this moment and not worth the money. But with that said, I really think the game has potential and would be really fun without the bugs. The game could really be alot more informative though. There are ALOT of things that needs info or at least a hint. Some things you can google, some things you cant. \\n\\nIf i was rating the bugs id give it a 11/10. I have never played a game with this many major bugs at the same time. Especially not ~3,5 years after release. Its not even an early access title. But even if it was, this wouldnt have been sufficient tbh. \\nThe game in total gets a 2/10 with alot of potential points to come.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'mma be honest, here: it\\'s boring. One of my friends convinced me to pick it up, and I\\'d seen a couple gameplay videos on it so I was like \"sure, fu.ck it.\" It has base building, exploration, space flight (in real time, mind, which is kinda weird but also kinda cool). Lots of cool toys to use. I was told that it was way better than it was at launch. It didn\\'t meet the high bar that\\'d been set.\\n\\nI get into the game (one of my friend\\'s already existing games), and spawn on a radioactive, caustic planet. If my friend hadn\\'t been there to provide the material I needed to constantly repair my suit, I\\'m sure I would have died quite a few times. However, my real bone to pick with, here, is the tutorial. It is LONG. It consists of finding your ship, finding materials, and running back and forth between ridiculously large distances just for the sake of repairing your ship and teaching you game mechanics.\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong with that?\" you may ask. Imagine you\\'re playing a different game. Let\\'s say Subnautica, instead. In the place of Subnautica\\'s short and sweet tooltips, necessary materials and such in the starting area, you have to swim all over the planet just to get your basic tools for survival (the scanner, the knife, etc). All of the dangerous fishes have already spawned in and you have to go into toxic areas, with limited protection. Imagine going through that. No bueno, yeah?',\n",

       "  'review': \"Look, I get it. This game used to be poo, now it's amazing with so many features. I've watched the Internet Historian video and its many permutations with people reacting to it. Great video, great game...\\n\\nBut I have to be honest here... it's kinda janky. Textures love to pop in and out of their blurry existence, and most importantly of all... the editable terrain loves, just LOVES, to revert back to its default state!\\n\\nYou're telling me, one of the game's CORE features of being able to reshape the world you're in, is hardcoded with a LIMIT? And if you go over that limit, well...\\n\\nMy base is in ruins, land forever sliding into it, no matter how much I try to manipulate the terrain, it keeps coming back.\\n\\nIt's heartbreaking.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Having played further, many of the game's features are unpolished and have some major level of jank. \\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n1. The UI's elements invisibly stacking, resulting in stuff like ship storage upgrading dialogue options suddenly causing the ship exchanging UI and dialogue to pop up, requiring a restart to refresh.\\n\\nThis stacking will cause problems when interacting with your freighter, and it has resulted in giving me one permanently uninteractible Fleet Command Room holding nonexistent frigates that CRASHES THE GAME whenever I interact with it.\\n\\n2. Freighter problems again. Apparently, if you summon your freighter on ANY system you deleted a Base/Base Computer in, the aforementioned Command Rooms will end up LOST and BLOCKED OFF. You end up having to fiddle with the Freighter room placements to be able to delete these lost rooms...\\n\\n3. Going into friends' bases when they're away is a horrendous experience. Stuff disappears and terrain resets (albeit temporarily) and the friend has to actually be present in the base if you want, oh let's say, 80-95% of the base to be there, depending on the base size.\\n\\n\\nOverall, while the team have been hard at work adding features and fixing bugs, they still have a long, LONG way to go when it comes to polishing and fully QA testing this diamond in the rough.\\n\\nAnd by rough, I mean REALLY rough.\\n\\n6/10\",\n",

Go get this material. Before you can harvest that material you need to repair your harvest tool. In order to do that, please run 800um over there to get that material. OK, repair tool. Now run back and gather that material. Oh, before you can find that material we need to craft a scanner, please run over that way and look for material to gather to build a scanner. OK, before we can build the scanner, please gather material to make a portable refinery. That material is on another planet, which requires we fix your ship, which requires another 45 different types of materials to be gathers. Opps, your gathering tool needs to be recharged, please gather material for that. Oh, your inventory is full? Drop something, and be very careful what it is, because your ship is out of fuel, and you will need to gather material to get to the place where you need to gather material to fix your material gathering tool. \\n\\nNope.

       "  'review': 'While this game already has a lot of contents, obviously the team doesn\\'t want to spend time to polish. I had so many annoying experiences the first day I play it:\\n* Every time the game starts it asks me which graphics card it should use. There is no way to let it remember. There seems to be a problem on the Vulkan driver version, but no cue provided on how to fix it.  \\n* You can\\'t find option in main screen. You have to start a game to change the graphics settings and restart the game to apply.\\n* Seems to support controller, but some functions are not working. (Sometimes but not always, when it tells me to press R3, pressing R3 does nothing. I have to press the corresponding key on keyboard.)\\n* You can make a mark on the map while using scanner (F key), but a mark is not displayed if it\\'s outside the screen region. As a result it often gets lost just under your feet when you approach it.\\n* There seems to have a limit on how deep you can dig, but I happened to have a \"buried technology module\" below that limit. Not sure how I am supposed to get it.\\n\\nEdit:\\nAs I proceed, I found that the task system (the main story line) is also broken. There might be enough hints, but you have to watch everything carefully, because the \"Log\" tab in the game does not provide any useful information. Once the task asked me to find a place with a mark, but again the mark is so difficult to find in space (not showed if you are facing wrong direction, not showed if you are not in the right system).\\nFinally I managed to get a solar panel and container up and running and I feel it is so late. As sandbox games featured by exploring and collecting, Minecraft and Terraria both allow you to store spare items in chest since the first few minutes of playing. This one takes >10 hours.',\n",

Trust me, I\\'m an 3xp3rt g@m3r (that\\'s \"expert gamer\" for all of you normies).\\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n[b] * Graphics: [/b] They\\'re really nice, but that\\'s about all NMS has to offer at this point. \\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n[b] * Gameplay: [/b] Lots of randomly generated creatures, plants, and geodes; but in the end you\\'re just running around mining/burning everything for the same materials you can get on just about any planet. \\n\\nOh, and then you get to play this really fun inventory management game where you never have enough space and are constantly running back to your ship/base to stash things -- all while burning a good portion of those materials you just gathered to refuel your mining tool, life support, and environmental protections that are constantly ticking away. The inventory mini game also aides in keeping you from striking out from your base or ship to explore the planets, which is a really cool gameplay mechanic.\\n\\n[b] * NPCs: [/b]  Flat and repetitive. Space stations all look the same. There\\'s a language mini game that does nothing except let you realize the NPCs are all saying the same lines, but just in different languages. There\\'s an effort to make the game LOOK like you\\'re not alone (NPC ships flying over on planets and taking off at space stations), but they serve no more purpose than the flaming angel animated GIFs on a late 90s Geocities website. \\n\\n[b] * Multiplayer: [/b] You can go to a hub where there are actual other players, but they\\'re just there to ignore each other and use the research stations. Outside of these hubs, you\\'re playing solo. I think you can pair up with a buddy and bring them to your instance of the game so you can \"enjoy\" the engaging deforestation sim together -- but I believe in Jesus.',\n",

This game is simply in the state it should have been on launch. Which is to say its ok. Now the fact that we are 4 years in (NMS was released in 2016) and it is STILL in this state is why it gets a bad review. This game would be fine if it was marketed as an early access indie game however this game came on day one with a $60 price tag and was marketed as a launch title on the PS4, it didnt come to  xbox until much later. \\n\\nThis game has a TON of performance problems and has crashed on me far too many times to be acceptable. \\nI have a Ryzen 7 2700x CPU and an RX 5700 GPU, which is OVERKILL for this game.\\n\\nBuy this game on sale for $20 which is what it should be priced at, in no way is this a full $60 AAA game.

Without prior knowledge you will die a lot of times until you get your ship running, each time confronted with a quote from some sci fi story. The first 3 times were okay, but it grew increasinly frustrating.\\n\\nWhat broke it for me was going to find a blue print that supposedly was hidden at the location of a marker on my HUD.

       "  'review': 'After 10 hours of playing the game now, and 10 hours at release, the game is still flat out not fun in survival , which is the most best mode. Everything is just refilling your life support, protection systems, fuel, constantly. And its not like you can avoid it, play smart to stay alive, its just constantly draining, ticking away pointlessly while you flail about with the stupid visor gimmick hunting down things that arent there, or are glitched into terrain, just so you can hold E and drag and drop it into an endless suck of material. Honestly, this game IS NOT worth your time, all the things you get to do simply cannot be worth the hours and hours of just holding left click and running around scanning utter garbage to try and find stuff that you use up in an instant and then have to go and find a heap more of. The physics are garbage. the forced 3rd person is atrocious. The camera spinning around and doings its own goddamn thing makes you seasick. The endless dragging and dropping and navigating the inventory is just unintuitive and frustrating. The ship flying physics are complete and utter nonsense, its like trying to ride a bicycle while completely slammed, and the steering is reversed and someone is constantly trying to push you over.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is the third time I’ve launched No Man’s Sky and attempted a play through. I love games where I can find a niche n a universe and go there away from real life and just live there for a time.  I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of a huge procedural universe. I keep coming back to NMS and I really want to live in their universe. Each time I come back it’s a heck of a lot better than the last time, but the is something missing. It just feels empty. \\n\\nHistory:  \\nThe first time I played was just after Beyond came out. Steam had a sale. A friend of mine and I bought the game and jumped in.  We spend maybe 5 hours fumbling with the clunky ui. We died like 10 times in the first 5 minutes. Then we figured out how to get sodium and oxygen and the challenge was over. After our first session my friend gave the game back and got a refund through Steam. I decided to keep the game with hopes that I might one day go back. \\n\\nThe second time I went in alone and was determined to endure beyond the clunkieness and find out if there was something I was missing beyond the learning curve. I worked through the story line, visited a few planets, started building my first base… Let me interject right here. Base building is my thing. I have over 4000 hours in Ark: Survival Evolved all of it on official pvp servers grinding out resources and building huge defensive functional bases. Life is Feudal, Haven and Hearth, Sub Nautica, even in Skyrim base building was my favorite part. But, the base building in NMS was so restrictive and the resource grinding so fumbly, bumbly, and boring I left halfway through my first wooden base and went back to Ark. \\n\\nPresent:\\nThird time is a charm? I still loved the idea of the game. While watching Internet Historian’s YouTube video on NMS, I laughed, I cried, (gaaaaay) and I decided to give NMS another go. Things have gotten significantly better. But….\\n\\n\\nThe good (Yes there is some good now): \\n1.\\t The options for base build are incredible. I was totally impressed with the number of options and the freedom. The system has been totally transformed for the good in comparison with my precious attempts at playing. It has so much potential. \\n2.\\tThe UI is less clunky and I am starting to understand the vision.\\n3.\\tIt’s huge.\\n4.\\tThe star ships, freighters, and frigates are super cool. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n1.\\tThere are no significant challenges. You die a few time in the first few minutes then it’s a handheld cake walk.\\n2.\\tThere is no reason to build a base. Maybe for elemental protection if you build on a hazardous planet. But, you can just jump back in your star ship and fly up to your freighter. \\n3.\\tInventory management is more than half of the game. Moving things from one inventory to another and back again over and over again. It’s not fun, it could easily be streamlined, but I think the developers are afraid if they removed the tedium of the inventory the game would have no challenges at all. \\n4.\\tThey’ve introduce a story to the game, but it’s an afterthought. It more like a long drawn out tutorial. The character are unmoving, the missions are boring, and I just going through the motions to get the upgrades. \\n5.\\tThe game feels dead despite all attempts to make it appear to be alive. For instance I’m standing on the surface of a planet that I just discovered naming all the plants and animals and every 5 minutes a squadron of faceless nameless NPC space ships fly over my head, Yet in the Anomaly, a space station where players from all over the enormous galaxy can go to meet and hang out, I can’t find anyone willing to talk to me. There aren’t even trolls! What, what, what!\\n6.\\tThere is no danger of loss, no planning necessary, or consequences for bad choices at all. For example in space there are asteroids everywhere. I mean everywhere. A constant cloud of asteroids filling the void between planets. But, these asteroids aren’t real. You can fly your ship right through them. You shoot them and get some resources. One of which is the fuel you need to travel between planets. So, there is no chance of running out of gas between planets. Let’s face it if you did run out of gas between planets you could always just reload a save game and start back at base. Or spend the twenty real time minuets it would take you to get to the next planet. But, those consequences are too dire hence the fog of ghost like asteroids. \\n7.\\tThe graphics are not good. The draw distance is horrible. I have a good rig. Walking across the surface of the planet the vegetation would pop in right in front of me and the animals some times wouldn’t register until I was already past them. Empty in front of me, turn around and oh! there are all the animals. \\n\\nIn conclusion: When I started writing this review my intention was to be mostly positive with a few critiques. But, when it came time to list the things I like about it I just couldn’t think of many and when I started writing about the things I didn’t the flood gate burst open. So, there you have it. If you already own NMS and you want to check out the new features go for it. The game is indistinguishable from the game I first played. If you don’t own it, I wouldn’t buy it. It’s a gigantic boring universe that I am leaving once again.',\n",

I have seen most updates for myself and if i did not get the chance to check all new features out, i read the patch notes. I will name two main problems the game has ALWAYS had and they were never even improved on, as far as i can see. Problem one: the game world feels lonely, empty and lifeless. NPC\\'s do not feel like NPC\\'s but furniture. Problem two: discoveries, exploration. Well there is nothing really to explore. Explore away, all you will see are different colors. Exploration is not rewarding in a gameplay sense as you will \"find\" nothing really. You will not come across unique NPC\\'s or quests. You will not \"unlock\" anything by discovering. So at the end of the day: you can build things  in a rather lonely setting in this game. With no real interaction or even combat really. I wouldn\\'t recommend it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I wanted to buy this game ever since it came out, but all of the controversy surrounding No Man\\'s Sky made me wait until more content was added. When the Beyond update was introduced I thought this is it, finally the game has enough content to be worth it. I bought on a Steam sale, download it and played it and, after 16 hours, I decided I had enough, at least until the next patch, because the game is bad.\\n\\nFirst the alien languages. Learning all of the words for all of the 3 main alien factions is fine, is a good mechanic, but it is so boringly implemented. You talk to aliens, find monoliths, complete missions for hours and you only learned 60 words, which might seem enough but you\\'ll still encountered aliens that use one of the words you have learned. Granted, it\\'s realistic but nonetheless boring.\\n\\nThe flying controls are good, they do their job, but once you get into some combat you\\'ll end up chasing the enemy through the whole system trying to aim at them. Games like Elite Dangerous and Everspace have controls that are suited for both combat and flying, so why can\\'t No Man\\'s Sky have some decent controls.\\n\\nIn my time playing I\\'ve visited 4 system, each controlled by a different faction, each with different planets that each have different weathers and resources and yet all of the hostile plants are the same. Either they are the \"fungus\" that releases toxins, the tentacle that hits you, the plant that inflates and explodes releasing toxins or the plants that bite you. But, while for the hostile plants is more noticeable, some rocks also share the same structure, like the pillars that contain cobalt.\\n\\nThe game run poorly, with lots of frame drops. I\\'ve played more recent more demanding games than No Man\\'s Sky and they run better. The game needs to be optimized, badly. \\n\\nFinally the bugs. In those 16 hours objects would fall through the floor, I wouldn\\'t be able to retrieve the resources that I stored on my containers, the roamer would become invisible every time I use one of those antenas that charts the maps on planets, monoliths and containers sometimes spawn floating in mid air, Biological Horrors would get stuck running in circles, sometimes I take fall damage when falling from a high place and sometimes I don\\'t, once I teleported from one planet to another and when I checked my inventory it show me the inventory for the roamer and never went away until I restarted the game, one time the game made me do a mission twice for no apparent reason.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but the truth is that No Man\\'s Sky is not ready to be played. With the bugs, the poor performance and the odd design choices the game feels more like it is in open beta, not ready for prime time yet. Wait for a big sale or more updates when they fix the problems before buying.\\n\\nP.S.: I know my english sucks, but it is my second language and I\\'m trying to improve it, that\\'s why I wrote this \"review\" on english.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game has potential, but it still has to be polished.\\n\\nTHE EXPERIENCE\\nI appreciate how far the game has come since launch. The game has had several large updates. The game has some resemblance to the feel of Subnautica, which made me hopeful. The soundtrack is mostly uninteresting and bland. It is hard to get immersed and in to the mood. \\n\\nUnlike in subnautica, here the story is more or less mandatory for you to get the technology to make real progress. It\\'s unfortunate, because it means that, initially there is one \"right way\" to play this \"sandbox\" game. For me so far, the story has only gotten in the way. It might be forgiven, but the story it\\'s self is not particularly interesting. I\\'d rather do my exploring in peace and after I\\'m more or less content, I\\'d go looking for the story and quests.\\n\\nThe game seems to have content, but I\\'m yet to find out, for how long will it entertain (39 hours played). It may last yet, as the game offers content at a very slow pace. The enjoyment per hour leaves something to be desired.\\n\\nThe start was slow and un-intuitive. The building menus were overwhelming. I\\'ve gotten mostly used to it, but the UI is a bit complicated at times, or at least unconventional. UI seems to be optimized for a controller, not keyboard. \\n\\nThe idea of \"learning\" alien languages is sort of interesting, but it\\'s slow and after almost 40 hours in, it has mostly lost its charm. I still don\\'t have nearly a full vocabulary of even the first language. You learn one word at a time and the word is never the one you need for context. I found it amusing that the alien language had words for \"a\" and \"the\", and both had to be learned separately. I would have much rather learn the words for \"trade\", \"price\" and \"kill\". \\n\\nWhen I first found a new crashed shipwreck I was exited to claim it. I didn\\'t have the materials or technology to completely fix it, but I was exited to work towards fixing the ship and making her fly. It would have been a fun and meaningful goal at just the right time. Imagine my disappointment when I come back with the first set of supplies and find the ship gone! Despawned! The first major bit of interesting gameplay content stolen from me. \\n\\nAfter searching the forums, it is currently a \"feature\" of the game. I\\'m supposed to not touch anything until I can fix the ship enough to make her fly. I wish I\\'d known! The \\n\\nIt turns out that only the flying bits (engines and drives) need to be fixed to enable takeoff. The rest effect only cargo space.\\n\\nBUGS\\nI\\'ve had some crashes and game refusing to start after. Some inventory gets stuck and requires clicking on the edges to free. Sometimes NPCs walk through walls or eachother. My base has despawned and needed reloading the planet (teleport out and back). There are several glitches that enable infinite cash or materials.\\n\\nGRAPHICS\\nGraphics look nice. I like how the rings of ringed planets are visible from the surface and the planets have day and night cycle, but you can always fly on to the opposite side, where the time of day is different. There are nice weather effects, on planets that have weather to speak of. Overhead clouds cast shadows on the ground.\\n\\nIt required some tinkering to get running \"well\" (almost 60 fps avg (50-75 fps)) on my R5 1600 and RX580 at 1440p. V-Sync was on by default. Disabling it helped a lot. I have FreeSync anyway. Also I had to disable HBAO. The minimum requirements give a wrong impression. A low end machine may run this, but it will not look like anyting modern.\\n\\nVERDICT\\nI\\'m on the fence with this one. There obviously is tons of stuff in the game, but the experience is lacking. There are too many bugs or unpolished features. I won\\'t say you shouldn\\'t buy this. I\\'m saying, you should know this if you buy the game. I didn\\'t pay the full price, thank God. I got it on sale for 27-ish €. I will continue playing and hoping my review is adventually proven wrong.\\n\\nI sincerely hope the devs polish the game. It\\'s not finished yet, but it may become great.\\n\\nThis game should be really be tagged \"Early Access\".',\n",

I, however, have no problem admitting it: I was fleeced.\\n\\nUnfortunately for everyone, the game is still very boring. No amount of uninspired base building or space combat can fix the cluttered UI, awful keyboard and mouse controls, and sheer technical failure. Pop-in is BAD in this game, even on top-end hardware, and the \"seamless transition\" from planet to space is only impressive until the first time space takes a bit too long to load, and you realize you\\'ve been staring at the flaming inside of a cockpit for 90 seconds instead of 10. And, to top it all off, it\\'s still a full-priced game! More than THREE YEARS after the most inauspicious launch of all time, and this studio still thinks the game is worth $60! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. In its attempt to do exploration, crafting, and space combat, it succeeds only in how quickly each aspect becomes SUPER BORING.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Waited 3 years to give this a shot. I let the dust settle down and extreme opinions of weirdly offended players fade away, all updates rolled out and stabilized. Seems like a good time to try NMS. Well, I played for less than two hours so i'll ask for a refund. NMS is definitely not for me. Here I will outline why and maybe it helps someone make a decision.\\n\\nThe highest gameplay level (the thing you do on a moment-to-moment basis) is very boring. You do 3 things:\\n1. Walk around and collect resources by clicking on things\\n2. Fly on your spaceship.\\n3. navigate menus and menus and more menus\\n\\nApart for item 3, writing it out like this makes it sound promising, but the implementation falls flat. The first two items are trivial. Walking around is understandably trivial but flying a spaceship? that's such a wasted opportunity to introduce interesting gameplay mechanics and challenges. Unfortunately it's the most trivial aspect of the game. You point and the ship goes. Zero regards for physics, which I understand is a matter of opinion, but at least that would add challenge to the game. Acquiring orbit, matching velocities, docking, landing etc. These things are rewarding to master, add a dose of challenge and real risk, which in turn would validate resource gathering for repairing or improving maneuverability. These things could be acquired without realism too, but it needs to be much more than point and go.\\n\\nAs is, the only motivation given by direct gameplay to gather resources is to... gather more resources. The storyline tries to motivate that by giving you a trail to follow. Signals left behind by someone or something. Interesting, but that doesn't hold on its own.\\n\\nThe third item, menu navigation, needs to be included in such a list because there is so much of it! And it's clumsy as hell too. It's just such a boring thing to be doing in a game that advertises itself as a space exploration game.\\n\\nAnd without challenge in flying, the exploration game mode is a hard sell too. It's a glorified atlas of a procedural universe. For that purpose one could do better with Space Engine, in my opinion.\\n\\nNone of this makes the game inherently bad, just not for me. If you are the kind of person who enjoys navigating menus to craft things that can be used to craft more things, give NMS a chance. I don't mean it sarcastically, it just sounds like it because I really don't like doing these things lol\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I have no idea where to start. I really wanted to like this game. I love a good survival base builder and have given No Man's Sky a good while since release to iron out the bugs and game play issues. At least so I thought.\\n\\nEverything about this game feels unpolished and unfinished. The ship flight is clunky and almost feels like a mini-game, the story mode is very poorly written and often leaves you questioning exactly what it is you're supposed to be doing. The space navigation system is poorly implemented and a chore to use. The resource gathering is riddled with bugs and feels little more than a grind. The 'unique worlds and creatures' feel repetitive and uninspiring. There was almost nothing about this game that I found enjoyable, and I usually love this kind of title.\\n\\nSeveral specific issues I personally encountered that were particularly annoying to me were the following:\\n\\n- when you mine a resource it almost always claims to still be present and doesn't disappear from the scanner HUD. I've read several post of people claiming that it's because you have to remove every single part of the resource from the ground first (a terrible design choice in the first place if that was the case) but even after meticulously removing what I'm mining I always perform a local scan to discover that the game still thinks a little bit of resource remains in thin air (and this continues after attempting to mine the thin air every way possible). This is effectively game breaking for a base building and resource gathering game.\\n\\n- more than once when mining through terrain to get to a location (a handy way to travel on worlds with environmental hazards) I've had the tunnel around me vanish resulting in me falling to my death. This game is supposed to be several years into release ... not in alpha.\\n\\n- Creatures or hazardous plants being able to still kill me through terrain if I am in a tunnel.\\n\\n- Very roughly 1 in 4 times when I'm attempting to travel to find resources using the visor scanner, I get to the site to discover it's just a lump in the ground with no actual resource there.\\n\\nI honestly can't see how this game has a single positive review. There are plenty of base building survival games out there and almost all of them are better than this one ...\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I got this game on sale for $30, and even at that price I can't suggest this game. I heard this game got a nice revival with updates for co-op and more, but the game still feels so empty. Let's address what I hated so much.\\n\\nCo-op\\n\\nEven though you're in co-op, you both still have the same exact missions you each individually have to do. You can't work together to complete the objective. Wanna build a base with your friend? Nope. The base terminal makes you claim ownership of land and though you can build with your friend, it's quite limited. Why is co-op in the game if nothing you do together matters?\\n\\nThe Grind\\n\\nThis entire game is just a massive grind of doing the same thing over and over and over. Mine. Turn that material into something. Complete your objective. Repeat. Oh and don't forget that you must CONSTANTLY be recharging things in your inventory. Your mining laser constantly needs fuel, as does your hazard protection, your life support, and your ship. You may enjoy the quests but you'll be grinding just to refuel those things throughout the whole playthrough. You also barely have any inventory space and it's extremely expensive to upgrade.\\n\\nNothing about this game was good other than the visuals being nice. Decent game for some nice screenshots. Unfortunately, I can't suggest this game unless it's dirt cheap.\",\n",

Can't mine in tunnels/caves without randomly teleporting outside above ground (lost count of how many times this happened). Can't edit terrains nearly at all - every change to the terrain respawns and undoes your work. Our entire base then also randomly despawned and we lost all of our progress. Enemies can hit you through the ground, so taking cover or hiding in a cave is pointless. We tried for hours to enjoy this game but with all of that going on, we're done. Hopefully your experience is better.\",\n",

The entire UI is a mess on PC and what makes it worse is that you need to constantly interact with the UI because you have a bunch of \"survival\" meters to top up every 5 minutes. Instead of food and water, though, it\\'s \"life support\" and \"environmental protection\". I don\\'t see how this was thought to be necessary at all. It simply means that instead of running or walking anywhere, you have to crawl around with your mining laser and pick up carbon and oxygen just so you don\\'t die. Perhaps after you get a lot of character upgrades then the game becomes bearable, but as it is right now I wouldn\\'t bother giving it a try.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I knew this game flopped on release, so decided to give it a few years and wait for a sale. Well I finally got it for $25 and can\\'t even believe that it\\'s not even worth this much. The game kills you off within the first minute playing on the easiest difficulty, so you can\\'t even figure out any part of the game. I also looked at the keybindings, and there are 6 different menus within the keybinding screen full of keybinds that look almost the same, yet can\\'t figure out because there\\'s no time to figure them out when the game kills you within the first minute.  There is also a cinematic thing when you start a new world that prevents you from skipping, moving your view, or moving your character, but at the same time still lets the environment deal damage to you, so you just have to sit there and watch yourself die while the camera pans from the sky to the ground for no apparent reason. Oh and the UI is extremely unintuitive, instead of having functions in the game tied to things you can keybind, you have to go through a \"quick menu\" which is not at all quick for simple things like changing from first person to third person that I only found on accident after my 4th death.',\n",

Of course, it wasn't even close to being as good as advertised, it lacked content, had performance issues etc. However, back then I saw great potential and I found myself playing it for many hours until I ran out of things to do. After so much time I decided to revisit the game. It is the exactly the same as before. Graphics got updated, it runs smoother but new graphical issues (such as the textures loading when you are on top of them due to Vulkan, which ruins everything) that did not exist back then, the world still being empty (just as it used to be) and the micromanaging being worse than it was back then makes it a STAY AWAY for me (unless you find it at 60%+ sale and ya got some money to burn)\",\n",

       "  'review': 'As it was 50% off and due to have been improved significantly since launch, I finally got this game. I was intrigued by the idea of an endless procedurally generated universe, among other things.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n- Nice crafting and base-building mechanics\\n- Basically impossible to get stuck without enough materials to continue\\n- The story and how it is presented\\n- Some planet diversity\\n- Awesome graphics\\n\\nThe bad:\\n- Planetary navigation. If you can procedurally generate a planet with points of interest, it must be possible to generate a map as well. That would also help with exploration.\\n- In-system navigation. The only help is the in-ship display, which does an incredibly poor job of telling you where you are and where you need to go.\\n- Galaxy navigation. It is atrocious, awful, terrible. There is simply no way to sugarcoat it. Please look at some 4X games (e.g., Stellaris) to see how it can be done properly.\\n- Base building vs. exploration: This game does not seem to be able to make up its mind if it wants to be an exploration game (the storyline mostly indicates that) or a base building game (which a lot of missions indicate). I could, of course, build bases all over the galaxy, but to what end?\\n- Space combat. Ugh. I almost got nauseous trying to shoot down planes. It may be realistic-ish, but it is bad.\\n- The lack of technology improvements. Scanning takes the same amount of time in the beginning as it takes in the end. Inter-planetary travel hardly improves.\\n- Language learning. I see almost no difference between the original translator, and the upgraded version. I am not even sure what the translator does, as I still need to learn the language one word at a time.\\n- The repetitiveness of everything. After having seen 20 planets, I had mostly seen it all. I am scanning the same plants and minerals over and over again, because somehow they are a little different than the same-looking ones from the previous planet. I keep shooting asteroids because fuel efficiency improvements are meh. I keep mining ferrite dust, carbon, etc., because my warp cell only lasts 5 jumps. I keep walking endlessly to mine stuff because somehow my spacecraft cannot show me where the deposits are on the planet. And so on.\\n\\nThe ugly:\\n- Cut scenes. Endless cut scenes. It is cute the first 2-3 times, but becomes very tedious afterwards.\\n- Orientation. Due to the poor navigation interface, it is very difficult to have any idea of where you are and/or where you are going.\\n- Lack of storage space. There are some improvements here, but it still gets me. Upgrades can only be bought one at a time, once per space station. And quickly become crazy expensive.\\n- Endless grinding. If you are the sort of person who enjoys grinding for resources, good for you. If not, this may not be the game for you. Maybe the base building helps here to some extent, but if so, it was unclear to me.',\n",

I spent 2 hours (in the version available during Dec 2019) trying to learn the game. I like the graphics and the universe concept, but it wasn't fun because it wasn't intuitive at all. And the tutorial portion of the game was very difficult to navigate. It was work, and I still don't understand it. I'm sorry because I really wanted to like it, but for me it's just not worth the time to learn it.\",\n",

You don't have to think nor have any kind of skill. I bought it for playing with my friend who lives abroad. We wanted to make a base together since we can't see each other irl. Well, only one player can own a base and if that player isn't online, the base vanishes. It isn't true multiplayer, it is single player alongside one another.\\n\\nNevertheless it has a nice procedual experience and neat visuals. That's all. I wish I could refund this game, but I've spent 8 hours walking on silly fetch missions and Steam won't give my money back. It still isn't worth the money and time.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I tried. I really tried to like this game. Flying in and out planets and system seamlessly sounded amazing and is done amazing in many ways, but the lack of reason to play and the variety of planet content was and still is a problem. There are so many bugs and inconsistent behaviours that takes away all the efforts from the developers to fix this game:\\n\\n- There is no sense of loss in this game. You can build and build and destroy all life that is current rendered in your current planet that it causes no problem. There is no penalty for killing fauna or harvesting flora too much. You go out to space, in to the planet, and everything is there again.\\n\\n- Following the same idea, when you clean up an area to build your base (like removing small rocks and plants), if you go out to space and return it will be filled with all those rocks and plants you just removed.\\n\\n- The dialog and story is pathetic. It\\'s not just bad, it is filled with generic meaningless dialog with no voice-over and with no sense at all. It is slow, you have to smash buttons to fast forward and sometimes you have to take actions that makes no difference in the end, the NPC will behave the same way and the outcome of a dialog is always the same.\\n\\n- It is way too repetitive. Quests are always about: Killing life in any planet, with no reason at all; Delivering item X from A to B, with some generic space pirates in your way; Scan mineral/plants, again, with no reason at all, with no specification about it. The game must have twenty types of planets yet it quests are not really engaging enough; Destroy supply depots that have either a walker or some sentinels.\\n\\n- There is no ship customization. You will have to patiently watch random ships landing and taking off from a space station until find something you like. Races, sectors or planets have no influence about what you will find.\\n\\n- Inventory management is poorly made. Once you put your items from inventory to storage, you can\\'t get a fraction of it, you can split in packs, you either get all or none. That\\'s one of the basic principles of stacking items.\\n\\n- You can buy blueprints for new buildings and base parts with an item called \"salvaged data\", but if you follow one of the main quest lines you will have to build and hire specialists that will research most of the machines available to buy with salvaged data.\\n\\n- There is no automation at all. You explore a planet, but you have to manually check and refuel some machines that, for whatever reason, can\\'t be connected to your power grid.\\n\\nThey are still updating it and adding content that should have been released ages ago. In the current state, it doesn\\'t worth the full price. Get it only in a major discount.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Played the game at launch, played through a few updates, and played with the most recent changes. The game has come a long way since inception, but one thing has stuck with it throughout. Some may call it \"an immersive sim\", but I call it \"slow and tedious\".\\n\\nSeemingly every action in the game is tied to a limit, a timer, or just slow interface. You don\\'t click on anything, you hold your button down for a second. You can\\'t specify a stack, you have to slowly change the stack by keeping a button pressed down. You can\\'t just mine, you have to avoid overheating and refill your batteries with plentiful resources. Traders in stations can\\'t be on the same level as you land, they have to be up on a ledge and out in the distance. You can\\'t grab all of items from one category to move between your ship and your backpack, you have to move each stack of 5-10 individually. You can\\'t simply scan a surface, you have to get a meaningless boot up message first before you get your options. You can research some upgrades in a small research tech you can place, but if you want more options you have to go into your spaceship, go into space, summon a station, fly in, sit through the landing/docking animation, run in to find the research vendor and only then are you allowed to spend your research points on something you wanted.\\n\\nAnd this is just the basic gameplay before you start getting into making money, upgrading your tools, buying spaceships, etc.\\n\\nNone of these are particularly egregious, but the entire game feels like moving with weights on. Everything drags and chips away at your patience bit by bit.\\n\\nIf you can stomach that and enjoy sandbox games, you can have fun with this game. Personally, I find it too tedious to enjoy it long-term.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is ok. I pre ordered it and played it a bit when it was first released. Was sorely disappointed, so I waited and after the synthesis update decided to give it another try. I would consider it in an early access state and definitely NOT worth $60! It still has so many issues. Some things have improved, but no much in my opinion. They added and changed a few things that help, but the same issues I dealt with before still exist. \\n\\nSo many things don\\'t work properly and the mission line needs some serious work. Mostly the advocates of this game focus on the \"infinite universe to explore\". Sounds neat, but after you visit a dozen or so planets you realize its just different combinations of the same 20 to 30 things. Planets and creatures mostly look and seem so similar that it becomes the same thing, over and over again. This has been tried to be hidden or distracted from by choosing different sounding names for the same things. All frozen planets are cold, snowy, icy places, but they can be called frost, frozen, glacier, freezing etc. Different names for the same thing. Its the same with all the planet types. Hot are called boiling or fiery or blazing. Toxic are called poisonous, or fungal etc. Every once in a while you might come across a planet or animal that surprises you, but not very often.  \\n\\nAside from the eventual boredom of the same things over and over again, there are a lot of issues with the set up of the missions. Specifically the order they force you to follow. For instance, the first thing you are required to build is a base computer which is under the portable menu, but once you establish your base, you can NEVER move it. Which means later, after you are able to build structures, you can\\'t put the stupid thing inside. Then, quite a long way down the road, after multiple missions doing other things, you are given an electromatic generator. Immediately finding out that the spot you chose for your base isn\\'t going to work because you aren\\'t on a hotspot, because you didn\\'t know about hotspots until now. So, you can either rely explicitly on solar power or move your entire base, start from scratch and rebuild. Solar power was frustrating for me as the panels don\\'t exactly indicate which direction they will face until after they are placed and you can\\'t pick them back up again. You end up being forced to move your base. The order of the missions should be different. A MOVEABLE base computer, followed by generators. Then, it should be exocraft third. Instead, you have mission after mission and upgrades and technology modules that require tons, literal tons of materials. Meaning you either have to hoof it all around the damn planet, or waste loads of fuel on your starship that only gets 4 lift offs flying from deposit to deposit. You don\\'t get the exocraft that is EXTREMELY helpful in traversing a planet on the ground and gathering materials until last. It is the last terminal you get which SUCKS! By then, you almost don\\'t need it! These are only a few of the problems I have found with the missions and their nonsensical order of progression.  There are tons more and they make game play extremely frustrating and unrewarding. You end up feeling cheated because you were forced to do things \"the hard way\" and grind like crazy only to find out that if things were just re ordered properly it would have made advancing a fun and rewarding experience. \\n\\nThen there are the CONSTANT bugs and weird things that happen. I have had knowledge stones suddenly morph into a crystal. Buildable recipes completely disappear, yet when I go to buy them, it says I already own them. Yet it won\\'t let me build them. Sometimes when I enter the build menu seemingly EVERY advanced item will be unlocked, I will even build some, then a minute later, none of them are available. This happens CONSTANTLY.\\nYou can\\'t walk through doorways, you have to jump. You can\\'t walk onto floors, you have to jump. Doors stay open when they are powered, making it impossible to put auto switches on them because they will close the door when you approach which is beyond stupid. \\nSometimes it doesn\\'t register that I am indoors even when I am and I have to refill my damn hazard charge or go sit in my ship to be safe from a storm. \\n\\nMultiplayer is all but useless. You can\\'t share the same storage. Can\\'t utilize the same base computer. It forces the other players that join your game to go build their own base to advance in their missions, which means you are just playing on your own anyway. The only benefit is that you can help others fight sentinels and pirates and you can trade items, but the whole thing is cumbersome and decidedly separate. \\n\\nBecause it will suddenly unlock items that shouldn\\'t be unlocked for you and then taking them away, it ends up corrupting your saves and the game gets CTD\\'S until you go in and clear certain files. It took several times, but I linked quite a few of these crashes to the game unlocking items that I shouldn\\'t have then taking them away. Other times I can\\'t figure out why it is crashing. \\n\\nI have also spent nanites on technology or recipes only to have them relocked after I save and quit. The next time I am on, all my nanites are still spent, but I have to re buy the damn things. It strangely seems to save only some things and not others. I found a crashed ship, claimed it, and got half of the things fixed on it. Only to log in the next day and it acted as if I had never claimed it. I had to re claim it and begin fixing it again. grinding for materials and jumping from solar system to solar system to look for parts or materials that I couldn\\'t build/find, only for it to do it again! I wasted nearly six hours and tons of materials trying to fix the damn ship 3 times before giving up. \\n\\nI will always hit the save point before exiting, and even though I return at the exact spot, a lot. A LOT of things I had done in the previous session won\\'t be there. Materials I gathered, certain items I made won\\'t be in my inventory. Machinery I built won\\'t be there etc. \\n\\nI have done everything I can on my end to make sure this stupid game runs smooth. I have all my drivers up to date, have verified files, uninstalled and reinstalled etc. This game is the issue. I have payed for over 100 hours and these things are CONSISTENT.\\n\\nNow, all that being said. It is still playable, as long as you can deal with the frustrations, but as I stated in the beginning, it is definitely in an early access state in my experience. It doesn\\'t run smooth, or feel fun. Its boring grinding and frustratingly repeating a lot of lost progress. Not to mention the rediculous cost of EVERYTHING. I haven\\'t even begun trying to earn enough to buy another ship, and frankly, I am just about burned out. I honestly don\\'t see how anyone can stick to playing this game continuously. \\n\\nI don\\'t recommend this. Wait another year or two and see if it improves. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"Went well for the first 15 hours.  Then I decided to do some heavy asteroid mining and everything went to crap.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to spend more than 10-15 minutes at a time mining asteroids without the game locking up and crashing on you.  If you mine an entire large asteroid there is a very good chance it will cause the game to crash on the last chunk.  Mining asteroids is the best way to make a large amount of credits in the early game and it crashes on every attempt.  It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to fly to a planet or a station to save our progress but for some reason we do which means we lose all our progress when the game crashes.  5x back to back this has happened to me now and cost me 2hrs of progress overall.  I played this game when it first came out on another platform and it's sad to see that years later we STILL can't go into space without having to worry about a crash and lost progress.  I give it a 5/10 until they finally fix the issues with the main theme of their game.\",\n",

The game has a ton of glitches, which the creators are diligent about fixing, but the worlds are so massive, there is always going to be glitches. I have logged appx 150 hours in the game hoping the quests would be more in depth, but nah. If you like free play and collecting stuff and having a huge number of coins, this game is for you.

       "  'review': \"There may be some issues, but this is the closest to alien exploration you can get. Maybe some day they can improve their algorithm to make for more custom planets and changing the colors of your starship. The game can eventually get dull after a while, but the exploration makes the game fun. Fixing those issues might keep players around. \\n\\nChanging the description for aliens and plants would be great too. The algorithm just shoves random and repetitive blurbs together depending on the lifeform, so being able to personalize that more might make players more into the game and scanning things. As for minerals, many have the same properties, so maybe making them scan-able and re-nameable once would be good. Also letting players know how many types of minerals, flora and fauna are on a planet would be nice too, so they know when they've 100% a planet or moon. As well as having planets with 'super life' (i.e. planets with a large sum of lifeforms, something like 50 fauna and 100 flora, and massive creatures) would be pretty neat as well. Finding fauna is one of the most fun aspects of No Mans Sky, after all.\\n\\nThe addition of dwarf planets and even rouge planets would be neat. especially if the rouges were only in the system for X amount of time, and without a base they would be unreachable practically forever, as they are only passing through the system. You could have them in various states, depending on how long they were away from their home star for, or the content of their atmosphere. For example, dense nitrogen atmospheres hold in heat really well, allowing for liquid water on its surface. If the planet brought along a moon or two, the tidal pressure exerted would help distribute heat around the planet, keeping liquid water on its surface.\\n\\nMaking more reasons to return to old systems and bases would be great too. As it stands, once you leave a system why go back? And your base is practically gone. Maybe when setting up the base computer you could have an option to place a pre-existing base for X amount of materials (like one third to half worth the initial cost of the build) and then you could continue to add on and re-save that build, as well as have multiple builds saved at a time. When placing the base, you could go into builder mode automatically, and an outline shows up with little AI scanners going around, and you can more easily place the base were you'd like. Then you could get your materials and return to the hologram outline and press a key to add them until the materials have been met and the base is built. Connecting parts of a base together could be as simple as a connector mode in the building option, and much like hooking up electricity in the game, you'd connect parts of your build together to be saved as your base.\\n\\nThose are just a few of the ideas to improve this game that I've had while playing. Overall, a very fun game to play.\\n\\nwould also love to add that the weekly quicksilver missions are not even possible to complete anymore. Straight up doesn't let me transfer the items to the mission even though i have all the  items. straight up bs.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Tried this game again since they supposedly patched it... Still buggy as hell. Multiplayer is still a poor experience. Even the single player is no fun. Stopped playing when they still had bugs in awakenings that caused npc's dialogue to break at the space station.\\n\\nThe biggest problems I think that plague it since the beginning is locking core gameplay mechanics behind required story missions in an open world environment. You basically have to do what the game wants you to do to unlock basic basebuilding features. It is an open world but you are punished in your capacity to create and use basic gameplay mechanics for not doing their fetch quest story missions. This in my opinion creates a lackluster linear experience. There's always creative I guess, for those that have no desire for any actual game content. Then again there is always minecraft for that.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I waited 3 years post release to get the game.  Hearing that they now allowed multiplayer and base building hooked me in.  Well.  After a hundred or so hours of play, I'm shelving the game for now and going to wait.  I cannot recommend this as a buy it now title.  It is better than it was, but it still isn't much of a game.  It is in a technical brilliant game and as a developer myself I can appreciate the proceedural generation work.\\n\\n The story is told through overly cryptic, short convo's without logical dialog branches.  Multiplayer only allows you to really be around your friends.  Very little reason to actually do anything in multiplayer.  Base building is ultimately pointless and unnecessary (all you need it for is processing higher tier ore and farming plants - which you can do elsewhere in the game).   \\n Base building especially around other people is buggy, putting another problem with actually doing this for multiplayer reasons.  \\n\\nAfter a while planets become very much the same thing arranged in different order.  Combat is not very challenging 90% of the time and you are almost never in any real danger (you don't have to defend your base).  \\n\\nYou can only have one frieghter in a system making multiplayer grouping silly.  And things are gererally easy to acquire if not just handed to you for little or no effort.  \\n\\nIt can be a better game, but it needs to be a game first.\",\n",

How do I know well I make games so why would you not want free updates to keep players coming. But how are you going to have an update that crashes every time you go through the portal that is needed to do missions. Its time wasting and frustrating due to the fact it cancels all progress in that mission and restart from square one. How does this make me want to play more. Once you've traveled so much the only thing to do is the Nexus missions but when you cant even come back to collect cuz the game has an unexpected error at the same spot 5 times. Yeah definitely liked this game but I am tired of these faulty errors that make me want to not play anymore.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is terrible.\\n\\nImagine if you took all the bad parts of Destiny, all the tedious chore-like grinding from Minecraft/Subnautica/etc., and then add the worst flightsim you\\'ve ever played. That\\'s No Man\\'s Sky. Here are a few highlights of why this is such a terrible game.\\n\\nWill they overwhelm you with options, upgrades, and countless types of materials? Yes. So if that\\'s your thing, go for it. But it feels hallow. Unlike subnautica where there\\'s a nice, healthy progression, NMS has the worst pace. It just opens up hundreds of options and no context for what you should/shouldn\\'t do.\\n\\nThere\\'s a visor you use to scan/scout things. You hold F to use it. Is there an option to make F toggle? No, because fuck you. Such a simple game design that they miss. And so using the scan for longer than 10 seconds (which you will do frequently) is annoying as hell.\\n\\nHow does a normal flightsim work? W&S are pitch (up/down), A&D are roll (think barrel roll), and Q&E are Yaw (think left/right in a tank). How does NMS work? You use your mouse to point where you want the plane to turn. It\\'s asinine. And it\\'d be one thing if that was the default and you could change to the normal pitch/roll/yaw. But you can\\'t, because fuck you.\\n\\nDo you like characters or plot? Think Destiny was bad? Well this makes Destiny feel like Firewatch or OG KOTOR. There\\'s this annoying \"learning alien words\" grind mechanic that just makes every NPC almost the exact same. Every space port: exact same with different name. And once you go to 5 or 10 planets, they\\'re all the same too. Do they have different names? Sure. But are they essentially the same? Yes. The procedural generation is this game is jut bad. And it FEELs worse.\\n\\nIf you want a good crafting/exploration game, go for Subnautica. Stay as far as you can away from NMS.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I gave this game a decent run through I believe. In the end my interest waned dramatically when I guess I realized there would be no narrative pay off ever, or if there is one, whatever was being setup didn't seem worth it.\\nIn terms of the selling points of an endless universe, it's there, but is thoroughly uninspiring. Of the planets I visited I found them to be 98% similar to others of their type. A radioactive planet is a radioactive planet. The plants will shift slightly, the creatures might have an extra wing. The potential wonder of an infinitely procedural universe is there, but in practice it seems dull and largely repetitive.\\nThe NPCs you encounter on any base seem like a software test from the early 90s. There's little to no reason to interact with them. There's a formulaic run through to learn a word, a tedious and unrewarding mechanic again.\\nSpace fights are dull beyond compare. I remember playing the original Wing Commander on PC with profound excitement. These feel like tech demos bolted onto the side. The enemy ships spin, fire, fly past. Your controls are designed for interplanetary navigation at a large scale. (Point, zip to location) so dog fights quickly become wrote and repetitive as well.\\n\\nBase building mechanic is interesting, but doesn't seemingly pay off in any interesting way other than to show others your base building prowess, which can be fun.\\n\\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game is obviously an afterthought. I tried it several times, only paired with another player once for a brief quest to throw treats at a heard of animals. \\nThe nexus, which was designed to bring players together doesn't feel like a social space at all. The instanced multiplayer that is available doesn't seem to add anything of note from my experience.\\n\\nI enthusiastically explored it for the first 40 hours of gameplay, my interest and curiosity in the environment maintained its momentum for the most part. There were a handful of moments where I just hit huge walls wondering where and what to do next.\\nAt the end, realizing that without any earnest narrative aspect in a game like this, all the missions you can get are go-for missions. Bring me thing. Goto building, it's a procedural universe, but every supply depot across 5-quintillion stars all look exactly the same.\\nGood for a lark, but I experienced a steep drop off in interest.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"As means of a full disclosure I purchased No Man's Sky while it was on sale.\\n\\nMy favorite thing about No Man's Sky is the space travel.  Being able to fly from the surface of a planet and rocket across the solar ship and touch down on another planet seamlessly feels incredible.  Unfortunately that's about the only good thing about the game.\\n\\nNMS is set up to reward exploration, except it doesn't ever fell like there's anything to explore.  If you touch down on a planet and look at everything you can immediately see then you've seen everything that planet has to offer.  There is some mild differences in it being a hot or cold planet, toxic or radiated.  But the only difference that has on gameplay is the color tint on the landscape.\\n  \\nThis is a minor person irritation, but all the wrong places seem populated. No matter how isolated or barren a planet I could find there were random npc ships flying over my head aimlessly.  The only point of civilization in each solar system is the space station which is a colossal structure which has like six guys on it, but there are hundreds of aliens patrolling directly over my base in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\nI had heard this game was horrifyingly disappoint at launch.  I can't imagine what it was like then because even now on sale I feel like I wasted my money.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I loved this game. Was an enjoyable and relaxing thing to goof with, in my downtime. Sure, it gets to be repetitive after a time. Sure, it's had some rather buggy messes that take awhile to hammer out, before new ones (and often old ones) appear from an update. The game has many flaws, but also many good qualities that made it worth playing, for me.\\n\\nThat came to an end after Beyond launched. Suddenly, a game I could always run nice, smooth and crisp, became the ONLY one in my entire library that BsoD's my computer, repeatedly. Change resolution? Blue Screen. Change any graphical setting? Blue Screen. So much as sniffle the wrong way while praying to whatever PC gods that my hardware wasn't failing? Blue Screen. \\n\\nJust tried the game, after a couple months hiatus and first thing that happens, when I go to change resolution.....effing Blue Screen. Tired of seeing everyone play it off that 'oh, it's on your end, it's your hardware, it's your hardware, it's your fault not the game'. Bullcrap. Seems if you're unlucky enough to have a 1060 6gb GPU (looks like the primary card this game now hates with a passion) you may be screwed. \\n\\nI did all the hardware scans, cleans, upgrades to RAM and checks I needed to do, short of rebuilding the damned computer and everything came back A. Effing. OK. But nope, guess it must be failing hardware, still. I loved this game and still would love to play it, but for the foreseeable future, it'll collect virtual dust in my library, because I'm sure as hell not going to dish out hundreds solely to rebuild, just for this game. That money will be put to better use for my kids, I love them more than this mess.\\n\\nOh and if I wanted to see a ton of blue on my screen, I'd make a freaking smurf simulator. Can't recommend this, as much as I hate to give it a thumbs down, I truly do, but I've been burned one too many times by this.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"No Man's Sky...does it really make a comeback after all this year from the horrendous broken promises of a game Dev? Good news is the Dev did not abandoned the game and still slowly pushing update. NMS really improve,a little....from their disappointing launch that shook the core of the gaming community galaxywide once. In 2019 No Man's Sky does improve from the heyday but still has many flaw within that really be a major drawback for many player. Long story short the current trailer and screenshot look fabulously immersive gorgeous but the game will never run that optimize unless you had one powerful gaming PC nor the content could offer immersive yet adventurous world to dwell in and explore, like the trailer.\\n\\n The NMS-Optimize rOooOOller-cOOooOOOoasteR ride is real, the FPS is climbing and dropping here,there,left,right and everywhere. The content is  literally GALAXY large but feel so empty at the same time. No Man's Sky feel like cardboard background world, All the exploration,planet and biomes feel like same sh!t different toilet, different toilet same sh!t, the worst it still cost premium entry charge.\\n \\n No Man Sky doesn't have the simple and yet in-depth immersive feeling like other survival+exploration games such as Subnautica,Astroneer or The Forest. In those mention title,their game is very simple yet fill with diversive details and the exploration will always take away another 5 minutes of your life. Those title made us feel so adventurous and immersive with every little things, that made us want to explore for more and more! That...No Man's Sky couldn't offer.\\n\\n Soundtrack does really blend impressive well with the game, credit had to be gaven for such a good immersion OST but wasted on bland empty LARGE galaxy with nothing to offer B.E.Y.O.N.D™. I sincerely love the game and hope to see No Man's Sky could offer more sustainable content, more attention on little details biomes and good optimization in the future but in the current state No Man's Sky doesn't worth the full price nor at 50% discounted sales, best at 65% discount and value at 70% discount currently.\\n\\n No Man's Sky is still a lovely game but with bad optimization,gamebreaking bugs and many missing details to make the world immersive enough. If you had a friend that wanna play together then it might worth the 50% discount due to companionship and together time. Else I strongly recommended just to check out Subnautica and others title of survival-explorer instead. \\n\\n To infinity and B.E.Y.O.N.D™ ! Your fighter jet somehow misflight and glitch stuck to the roof...Your last save 60 mins ago.....GAH!!! @#$#%^$&^%*(*^FUKK!!!\",\n",

There are many other bugs; quests that I signed up for aren't there, replaced by ones I don't do (kill quests).  Yet somehow my quest cue is now full of them.  I could go on and on and on.  I enjoyed this game for about 5 hours.  But then the bugs and grinding monotony are just too much.  I'm bored and annoyed.

But i will go with a negative review because this game does not have enough content to justify the insane price they put on it and in my openion should be in alpha its still too clunky and unfinished\\nNo Man Sky tries to be alot of things. Building, shooting, crafting, space combat, exploration etc.. unfortunatelly its just not enough of any of those and becomes repeatative fast. The world is indeed innormouse every planet is huge every system has 1-8 planets and there's pretty much an uncountable amount of systems.. however there's a couple of serious issues with that. first of all there's no biomes or rather very little biomes in the planets if you find a frozen planet its 90% frozen if you find a green one its 90% green. There's only a few types of biomes with very little difference between one lets say fiary planet to another and the generated structures on those planets are limited as well all adding up to exploring one planet is all the exploration your getting You can go and explore a new planet but your just gonna end up on a different shade of the same buildings and sites. The game has a crafting system which is unfortunatelly mostly used for making money and you need to go through an endless building hunt to unlock the recepies for that.. there's missions but they range between 5 different variations and after that its just more of the same. all and all. You can build your base which is really cool but the moment you join somebodies game the issues start... your base only half loads on their end.. they cant interact with most things.. the containers are personalised the terrain your demolished keeps regrowing inside the base (lets say you take down a tree to build a room.. well the tree just pops clipping through your entire struckture). Now all that said the game is still being updated and hopefully in a couple of years we'll get something playable.\",\n",

Base building. I spent half of my day yesterday just building a base just to find out later that it's raining inside the house (bad outside effects works inside the house) spent the other half trying to put on roof at different heights but nothing worked. I don't have any motivation to play more if i can't build a new working base/home.\\n\\n2. I bought this game mainly because of VR, which is unplayable at the moment (for me) as the HUD is stuck in one place. So if the HUD is behind you , you have to literally turn your head/body around to check your health or if you're not dying from lack of oxygen or something.\\n\\nAlmost everything else in VR is made right, it's not just a simple port, you take out your gun by reaching your back, spaceship has amazing controls (you need to control buttons/sticks in the cockpit)\",\n",

Menus, inventory management, and game play all feel very inefficient and tedious and are a serious barrier to enjoying the game. I thought having experience with games like Mine Craft and Creativerse would have made the transition to this game easier but No Man's Sky is a different animal even tho it shares many concepts (crafting, farming, taming animals). Meaningful achievements are too spread out and short lived when you find yourself needing to complete more time consuming tedious tasks to reach your next goal. It is an overwhelmingly large gaming experience which would be exciting until your brain does the math and realizes how much time it would take to accomplish what you want in the game.\\n\\nIn short it's a game that could be amazing but shoots itself in the foot by asking too much micromanagement of the gamer. (Just auto-refill all my technology if i have the resources, geez!)\\n\\nNot worth the $60 or even the $30 sale price I paid for it. $10, maybe... until they balance out the game play.\",\n",

I played for about 65 hours total back then but ended up getting bored and moving on.\\n\\nRecently, I came back to check out all the updates Ive heard about since then.  It really is impressive the amount of content that has been added, completely changing the experience of the game.  Theres a lot to do and check out.  The few issues I had thought were enough to not recommend though.\\n\\nMy computer isnt amazing, but I am able to play games like destiny 2 on max graphics or Ark on high with no issues.  This game, no matter how much I messed with settings, has massive FPS issues when entering buildings, getting in any exocraft, or entering a new chunk of land.  Exocrafts randomly decide to become invisible temporarily when exiting sometimes, normally fixed when reloading.  Also random machines inside my base temporarily disappear, fixed the same way but all items inside the machines dont come back.  \\n\\nWhile trying to explore i had issues with fauna disappearing and spawning right in from of me.  Also any aquatic animals do not exist until being underwater for about 5 seconds and disappear again when you surface.\\n\\nOverall I found all the new stuff very impressive, but all my issues were with things that have been in the game for a while now and were game disrupting enough for me to not recommend this, even with all the free updates.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So I actually like the game and will play it more. Despite all bugs and unfinished systems. But I will probably never give this game a positive raiting because of two things.\\n1. Sentinels. Too many planets have them. On survival every planet is full of them. Every 10 seconds or so you have to dodge this stupid flying vermin. If you kill one even more will spawn at exactly your location. Yes survival should be harder, but not like this. Sentinels are dumb and not interesting. They just annoy you in every step of the way. Sentinel spawn rates, AI and how sentinels work should be completely reworked or even removed.\\n2. Space pirates. Same as with sentinels. Encounters are too frequent and uninteresting. Always the same. They are easy to run away from, easy to kill. 0 fun and gain in actually fighting them. Same as with sentinels the spawn rate and whole system maybe even space combat should be redone. So if space pirates attack you it would actually mean something, be different and fun to fight with them.\\n\\nRight now sentinels and pirates are just annoying vermins. Despite all bugs these two things are the actual fun killers of normal and especially survival game modes. I like survival mode and I do not mind a little more grinding to get things I want, but these two things are not the way survival should feel like. Sentinels and pirates are ruining a possibility to enjoy this amazing, beautiful and enormous universe. I cannot stress enough how much I hate sentinels and pirates in this game and how much they are ruining the experience.\\n\\nI really hope developers will make things better with pirates and sentinels. Fix more bugs and add more content. If this is the case I personally would not mind paying for DLC if this is something developers need to support this game even longer than they already have.\\n\\nEdit 28.11.2019: Got to give developers credit for synthesis update. Great job and awesome update. But still do not see any changes to sentinels and space pirates!',\n",

Ore deposits that can't be mined out leaving ghost-ore behind, POIs spawning under the bedrock, or inside each other, or just leaving a marker with nothing there at all, invisible objects that you can't walk through... which in one case trapped me on a freighter and I had to log out with out saving, losing 1/3rd of my credits and a bunch of my inventory because I could not get back to my ship to leave.\\n\\nSo yeah, feature complete finally (years later)? Sure. \\n\\nGood? Playable? ... Not so much.\\n\\n*** Update at 165 hours played as requested by steam... ***\\n\\nJust before returning to this page after having to force-exit the game and lose more progress I ran into, in a few minutes, the following bugs:\\n\\n* Mission Rewards not matching rewards advertised on taking the mission, substituting cheap trash for the very valuable eggs I was after.\\n* Missions vanishing entirely.\\n* Faction icons not matching faction given.\\n* Feedback text overwriting itself too fast to be read.\\n\\nAnd finally:\\n\\n* On exiting from turning in missions my game getting the camera stuck on the turn-in NPC, orbiting it and not allowing me to interact with it or anything else. The only solution I could find was to force the program to exit, and load from the time I entered the station.\\n\\nSo why am I playing? I like exploring, and I like bright vivid colors. :P\\n\\n*** More Update ***\\n\\nThe main quest just vanished out of my quest log. I mean. I literally can not finish the story now short of starting a new playthrough. After 165+ hours or whatever it is now.\\n\\nDespite all the other bugs I could mention, I believe this particular one sums up my No Man's Sky experience.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b]The positives:[/b]\\n\\n-Loading times are nonexistent after booting up into the game. You can freely fly in space and enter planets without a single load time. Only exist when you use the warp feature to visit nearby systems. Very impressed by that. \\n\\n-You do feel a sense of exploration when playing this game. You can discover planets and rename each organism, mineral and plant to your own accord.\\n\\n-Has interesting mechanics like the language learning of different alien species. You can´t understand them at the beginning and have to learn their words to properly make out their speech. \\n\\n-Improved multiplayer capabilities. Now you can undergo missions with other players and take on tasks together. Very nice recent addition to the game. \\n\\n-Game offers different play style options for people. Some might play the game as a pure exploration game, some might have fun making money and crashing the economy of some systems and there is also base building for those who have fun creating structures on their own. \\n\\n\\n[b]The Negatives:[/b]\\n\\n-Terrain loading is horrible. Constant pop ins of animals or trees, Makes it hard to fly low on a planet when there is the danger of flying against a tree that suddenly appears in front of you. \\n\\n-Textures randomly don´t load correctly, causing npc´s and environments to use the low poly version, intended for far away objects to save on hardware resources. \\n\\n-Placement problems with buildings, regarding the freighter. Some rooms like the command room glitch out when trying to place, makes it nearly impossible to set it up without very precise placement on a specific spot. \\n\\n-Planets feel very similar to each other. Once you visited a handful of them, you know what to expect from the terrain generation. Looking at the 1.0 footage of the game shows more variety in planet generation, with more interesting structures than we currently have. I Propose an overwork of this feature, give the system more freedom and choices when generating a planet. \\n\\n\\n[b]Tldr:[/b] Nice and fun game about space with lots of various things to offer for the player, but it´s held back by the countless technical issues and bugs. If they ever get fixed, especially the terrain loading bug, I would recommend this game. As of now, only on a sale. Full price is currently not justified.',\n",

       "  'review': \"TL;DR Summary: An overly ambitious concept game from a team who clearly know how to dream, but not how to execute. As a result, the game remains in a permanent beta state that, as of now, just barely fulfills the promises made five years ago - once you get past all the bugs and quirks.\\n\\nDon’t let my play time fool you, those 294 hours are not an endorsement to the quality of the game, rather, they are a sad testament to my personal flavour of obsessive crazy, and the combined result of three separate instances of trying out this game. The first was launch day, where I had pre-ordered the game only to find it wouldn’t even run on my rig, despite my specs grossly exceeding the minimums – though that actually made me lucky, since it let me refund the launch price and then watch the overwhelmingly negative reviews roll in. The second was about 18 months ago, after one of the major updates, where I repurchased at a much lower price, messed around for a few hours, and quit out of boredom. It was only on the third try, after the BEYOND update and watching a friend stream some gameplay, that No Man’s Sky finally hooked me.\\n\\nLooking at this game’s spotty history it’s clear that Hello Games are a passionate group of artists who genuinely want to produce their vision, but I cannot help but imagine their development meetings being similar to two first-year college students, one a first year physics major and the other first year philosophy, both stoned out of their gourds with quality weed, discussing the universe and its purpose. A lot of crazy ideas, most of which only sound brilliant to them, and the few potential diamonds that come from their ramblings barely understood in the garbled memories and shorthand notes found the next day. They came up with an awesome idea, and presented it in a surprisingly dark and ominous setting. But the development is clearly scattered and on “valve time”, with priorities shifting from update to update and questionable focus (such as three times as many different types of craftable food than types of planets. I wish that was a joke). More than three years later, it’s still in an unpolished beta state, riddled with bugs and severely lacking in quality of life features, and with the clear understanding anything can be changed and corrupted with each update, even the core procedural generation that might just rewrite the entire universe. \\n\\nSo how did this mess hook me? The aforementioned setting. It’s not apparent right away, which is why I missed it on my second try, but as you progress past the initial survival scramble and start dipping your toe into the vast stellar ocean, a bunch of small things you notice soon snowball into a simple realization.\\n\\n[b]The universe is rotting.[/b]\\n\\nThere’s something fundamentally wrong about the state of the galaxy, and rotting is the best word I can think of to explain the feeling. This is not a (cosmic scale) young and growing universe like our own; the universe of No Man’s Sky is old, and under its sheen of being fully settled and populated, it is decaying, like some infection is slowly and irreversibly destroying it. And given how much of that decay is tied to logs and notes that are the only communication in a language you understand...[b]you might just be the one of the viruses[/b]. \\n\\nBecause you are alone. There’s three races that cohabitate all known areas of the galaxy – the [strike]Vulcans[/strike] Korvax, the [strike]Klingons[/strike] Vy’keen, and the [strike]Ferengi[/strike] Gek – but it seems not so much as that they have conquered the galaxy, as that they merely inhabit it, inheriting a network and technology and entire civilization that came before, and that for some reason has disappeared, leaving only artifacts and the omnipresent Sentinels to police the universe to their unwavering lawful neutral agenda. And in meeting those races, it is clear that you’re not one of them. Their languages are garbled to you, but they seem to treat you with respect that borders on fear. Only when you explore, wandering across planetary landscapes littered with discarded trash, broken machinery, and abandoned crash sites, will you eventually come across a language you understand. But that will bring you no comfort, for these words either come as creepypasta extracted from the slime covered computer of an infested and abandoned building, or from some ancient relic that predates the three races above, or from some freakish entity, glowing and ephemeral, speaking either of nonsense or of certain doom. Like them, you are an anomaly. \\n\\n[b]You are a Traveller.[/b]\\n\\nSo yeah, it hooked me.  But as said before, the actual mechanics of how this all works, of the gameplay that you go through to make the story progress from there, and that fulfils the original promise of “endless exploration in an infinite but shared universe” falls flat. It is incredibly grindy, repetitive, poorly optimised, and full of stupid bugs that even the most basic quality assurance procedures should catch. All the reviews seem to quote “wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle”, and I’ll repeat it since it’s 100% correct. There are only 9 planet templates – which, if you’re generous grows to 15 if you count “with oceans” and “without oceans” as different, but I don’t – and only the rarest two of those templates have any meaningful subtypes. The challenge curve is negative, because the universe is so generic that nothing changes with your travels aside from you personally growing stronger with upgrades to your suit, weapon, and ship. And those upgrades take forever, as the increments of improvement are often so minor, or only available at the whim of RNGeezus. So you just keep going to the same places, and doing the same things, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and it gets mindlessly easier every time. By the time I reached the centre, I had to travel through 297 systems, and since I [strike]wanted[/strike] obsessively felt I had to “tag” every planet, that meant I landed on and at least nominally explored (as in, stood in one place and scanned everything I could see) 588 planets – so yes, I cherry-picked systems that only had one or two planets whenever I could.\\n\\nAnd then, after 294 hours of that and finally reaching the centre, you apparently stop and write a negative review. Because, like I said, personal flavour of obsessive crazy. To hammer home the point, I was going to end with just a laundry list of stuff that annoyed me, and kept the game from ever being fun, rather than something I just felt I had to finish.  Which would have been fitting, because just like this review wouldn't have had a proper end, neither does the game. This list was as of the BEYOND update, and is scattered, incomplete, and only loosely organized. Again, like the game itself. \\n\\nBut it's so long, it would make the review exceed the word count. Too much ambition, not enough execution. So it is fitting, after all.\\n\\nIt's in the comments below.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"TL:DR - the game doesn't support a traditional 'joystick,' and certainly not a HOTAS.\\n\\nWhen No Many's Sky was released, it fell short of the hype.  That has certainly dramatically improved.  But even though it fell short, I enjoyed the game.  It did not advertise nor support using a traditional Joystick.  It worked with the Xbox 360 controller only.  Personally, I do not enjoy using a gamepad or mouse to 'fly' a space ship.  So I used x360ce to emulate the Xbox360 controller.  And then I used my Logitech or Thrustmaster to control the ship.\\n\\nBut then along came the BEYOND update.  And Hello Games made the decision to integrate with Steam BIg Picture.  That bricked x360ce, and so the game is back to just supporting a mouse or a gamepad.  Oh, sure, you can map a generic controller in Steam Big Picture.  But the problem is, to map a generic controller as a 360 or steam controller, it has to have at least as many buttons as the one you're emulating.  Therefore, neither my joystick nor HOTAS will work anymore.\\n\\nFor this reason I can't recommend this game.\\n\\nIf you find a workaround, then great!  The core game is fun.  There is plenty to do (despite some reviews.)\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is one of the best/worst games out there. I hate needing to rate this as either Recommended or not Recommended. This would be very neutral for me. However, since those are the options, I need to lean on the not recommended side. Don’t let that sway you from picking the game up on a sale. It’s an interesting game. \\n\\nTLDR: Awesome exploration game. Riddled with game breaking bugs that have been around for years. HG still hasn’t taken necessary steps to fix them, rather they’re worried about providing VR to 1% of the players.\\n\\n [h1] Pros  [/h1]\\n1. Great looking game.\\n \\n2. Awesome exploration concept. Who doesn’t like being able to travel from solar system to solar system exploring multiple galaxies?\\n\\n3. I love the building/crafting in this game. I love grindy games. Don’t get it wrong either. This is about as grindy as you can get. \\n\\n [h1] Cons  [/h1]\\n1. Bugs galore. Hello Games is TERRIBLE at correcting bugs. There’re bugs that’ve been around since the inception. Some are quite game braking. Countless times I’ll be doing a main story quest, just to have it stop working. When that happens, there are only two things you can do. Keep grinding out mats, and pray to Jesus that it un-f*cks itself and starts working. Or kiss your 90 hour save goodbye, and start all over. No idea why this isn’t a to priority for HG. \\n\\n2. Materials are still disappearing from harvesters, refiners, mining units etc. nobody likes wasting time.\\n\\n3. The terrain still “grows” back. Meaning that after you level off a nice area and build your base. The next time you log in, prepare to have your base filled in with sediment. What makes it even better is, you can’t use your terrain tool to clear it out most of the time. Because you can’t use the terrain gun while in a habitat. So, you must destroy your base, and rebuild. \\n\\n [h1] Conclusion  [/h1] \\nI’ve spent more time trying to work around game bugs than playing the game. Either by going back and forth a hundred times trying to get a mission to properly start, or constantly saving the game, shutting it down and trying to edit the save files so that I can get some sort of progression. I’ve finally realized that enough is enough. There are plenty of other games out there that’re more deserving of your time than this one.\\nThis game is not worth $60 USD. Pick it up on a sale sometime. Definitely don’t pay $60 for an unfinished game. \\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'First, after close to 300h in I surely think the game\\'s concept is pretty awesome and worthwile. IF only the most severe bugs were tracked down.\\n\\nEspecially resets and not saving progress can make the game overly frustrating. I write this as a warning, in my first like 50 hours none of it was a big issue, but it became a growing pain.\\n\\n- Base building: If you build a base, don\\'t even bother removing or editing terrain and beware building it inside a mountain. All terrain will grow back and overgrow your base, including facilities, landing platforms, doors etc. Plants and rocks will regrow through the floors even.\\n\\n- Bases on Freighters: A mobile base, how cool is that. However, only if you NEVER move your freighter you should try this. I built couple hours on the interior, storages, plants, rooms, neat decorations, even a manual saving point because, ya know, saving is everything after all this work. Few hours later I warped my freighter to my home base, thinking about nothing bad and *poof* each and every single customization was gone. Completely. Reset to zero and of course not even giving me back materials. I mean, really???\\n\\n- Explorations: The game is all about exploring randomly generated star systems. You can literally name everything, every planet, every plant, every animal, make it yours. Sounds great, huh? Only that after a couple planets it all gets - likely - overwritten by your newer discoveries. How hard it is to SAVE customizations and explorations in the cloud and provide them when I revisit a planet? Yes, you can re-explore and re-scan everything on the older planets you discovered and eventually the old names (if they were uploaded to the server before) show again.\\nBut this is not what makes you feel like progressing. Even space stations you visit reset completely after a while, as if you never talked to anyone there. What are bazillion planets for if you don\\'t really need to move; you can stay where you are and rediscover old stuff over and over again since the game forgets you were there, all the time. Hardly anything gets saved.\\n\\nThere\\'s a hell lot of other bugs like facilities not working, false info, storages not accessible at times, modules not building, multiplayer issues (the game is single player, originally, and it shows everywhere) etc. However, I don\\'t mind all these. Save my customizations, buildings and explorations already and I\\'d be happily recommending the game, wholeheartedly.\\n\\nAlso despite infinite planets the game got a definite ending point where you got the feeling to have it played \"through\". After doing all quests you only can do the ever-same 3 dailies, one more daily task for Quicksilver or randomly explore planets which are no longer really surprising, though. Once you know the main \"types\" this is all pretty repetitive.\\nIt\\'s nice to come back now and then, also I stayed much longer than friends, but it simply won\\'t tie you up as much (or at all) anymore, once there\\'s no longer real goals to pursue.\\n',\n",

However, the reason for this negative review is simply that playing cooperative is nearly impossible due to constant and extremely gamebreaking bugs. It is nearly impossible to last more than 10 minutes (and even that is being generous) in a coop game without having your friends disappear completely, having your base implode into a black hole and disappear forever, or even having all of your AI companions delete themselves from existence.\\n\\nI don't usually write reviews but I had noticed a significant lack of other reviews mentioning these annoying and experience-ruining bugs that plague every playthrough I've had with my friends, and I simply cannot recommend that anyone purchases this game if they're looking for a smooth coop experience because you won't find it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I really want to be able to recommend this game, and if you're really into grinding for the sake of grinding, then this is your dream game. Otherwise the glitch filled void that is No Man's Sky gets super repetitive with no real payoff. There still isn't any 'end game' content, which would be fine if the sandbox elements had some tangible value, and worked. For example, base building, it is feature lacking, buggy, and objectively pointless, due to freighters and how every space station has a teleporter.  Not to mention the many bugs that plague basic gameplay like; dialogue, object collision, enemy A.I, player physics, and even opening containers. Like I said, I really want to recommend this game, it is a really cool concept and I think that hello games should be praised for sticking with a game that had such a rough launch, but until the game has any gameplay or sandbox features that give you something to do other than scanning and grinding for ships, I cannot in good conscience recommend it.\",\n",

First, the annoying robot voice that won't stop telling you that your systems are failing. Every time you go out in the open it has to announce it. Also, it would be nice if it gave you invincibility for your first time playing. For the tutorial. I died 4-5 times during the part where I was supposed to be learning how to play. Or maybe the scanner shouldn't have a cool down during the tutorial since it kept telling me to use the scanner to find something, but I used it inside so it didn't find anything. And it kept bothering me to use the scanner when I was in cool down. Overall, if you like dying a lot, go ahead and buy the game. If not, well don't. It kind of pains me to write a bad review for a game as I haven't ever before.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve heard so many mixed reviews about NO MAN\\'S SKY that made me wonder what all the fuzz was about. On the surface the game seems to be something I might enjoy, combining exploration on a vast scale, building, crafting and handsome looking graphics. The asking price of $60 promises a AAA title, so when it was on sale the other day, both on Steam and on GOG, I picked it up and had a look at it.\\n\\nI\\'m coming into this game cold, not knowing what to expect. I literally had no expectations, other than the hope of having a good time. Sadly that didn\\'t happen. It can be like that with complex games though, you have to give it an hour or two to get into them, learn the interface, understand what you\\'re supposed to do. Good games (like any good software) will help you make this a welcoming experience. \\n\\nNO MAN\\'S SKY doesn\\'t do that. It\\'s not even trying. \\n\\nThe premise of the game is that we\\'ve lost our memory, crash landed on a planet, our space ship is broken, life support in our suit is failing, and we have to find  way to survive (not necessarily in that order). We need to fix that multi tool, hunt for resources, build some spare parts and get off this rock. Where have I heard that story before?\\n\\nWhat usually happens is that you\\'re given a quick tutorial as to what buttons to press and how to do things. Like a brief tutorial, even if it\\'s disguised as a mission of sorts. NO MAN\\'S SKY doesn\\'t do that. Instead you\\'re left to figure out an overly complex, unintuitive, badly designed interface all by yourself. No matter what buttons I pressed, it was not obvious to me how to navigate around. I was playing with a game controller, and while it is fully supported and recognised, the mapping and navigation wasn\\'t really made for it - nor did they try very hard getting to get it right. Bizarre concept for a console release.\\n\\nEventually I figured out the basics, after what feels like half an hour, and it certainly wasn\\'t fun getting to that point. The next thing the game does is send you far away to a distant point in the desolate landscape, to retrieve some vital part necessary for fixing my ship. To get there we have to walk 20 minutes through a wasteland that is the procedurally generated planet. We meet some procedural animals, plants, marvel at the day/night cycle and the ever changing light effects, all the while making sure we don\\'t die of heat exposure. Nothing else happens. For 20 minutes of my life. \\n\\nWhen we finally retrieve that \"thing\" we need, we walk back to our ship, through the same landscape we\\'ve already seen, for yet another 20 minutes. We may encounter a structure to explore on the way, but it becomes painfully obvious that perhaps a car or some other form of transportation would come in handy. Maybe at some point we\\'ll find out how to build one, but it doesn\\'t help us right now - having just wasted 40 minutes of our lives doing nothing other than push that left thumb stick forward, or hold down the W key. We finally get back to the ship, put that part in, only to find out that we now have to find some resources to progress. We walk around, we scan things, we use that laster thing to harvest things, and that about wraps it up for my two hour test of the game.\\n\\nSo what just happened? Am I hooked on NO MAN\\'S SKY? Am I eager to see where this is going? What other worlds and wonders lie ahead? How am I feeling? Is this the beginning of an exciting journey, an intriguing story that I can\\'t wait to see unfold?\\n\\nActually no. I\\'m frustrated, disappointed, bored to death with this game. The feeling of having been ripped off seeps in, so much so that I take a look at Steam\\'s refund policy. It\\'s that bad!\\nI truly appreciate what Hello Games have tried to implement here: a fully procedural universe with (probably) tons of features, lush underwater worlds, vehicles and buildings I could build, uncover intriguing mysteries - but it seems that I\\'m destined never to see any of that. Had it not been for the various launch and update trailers, I would have no idea those things even exist in the game.\\n\\nSo I give NO MAN\\'S SKY the benefit of the doubt and start a new game, this time in creative mode. That\\'s the one where we don\\'t have to worry about survival or resource hunting. We can just start building things and see if that\\'s more welcoming. I know it greatly helped me get the hang of Subnautica. But that logic doesn\\'t hold true here: the interface is so unintuitive that it\\'s impossible for me to work out how to build anything.\\n\\nThe final  thing I\\'ve tried was to leave the planet, and see what another procedurally generated world might look like. Be dazzled by that no-loading-screen take-off and landing sequence I\\'ve heard so much about. So I jump into my (magically no longer damaged) space ship, exploring the cockpit, and... nothing. All I can do is get in and out. There are no controls, no buttons, no explanations, no nothing. Are they serious? Nobody noticed these fatal design flaws during play testing?\\nPuzzled and confused, I go back into my previous game. There has to be more to NO MAN\\'S SKY than this. I spend another hour walking around, trying really hard to like this game. Knowing full well that \"this\" can\\'t be everything. There has to be something here that hooks the player\\'s attention before they hit \"uninstall\". But no matter what I do, all I feel at this point is that this game isn\\'t for me. Perhaps it\\'s totally obvious what players have to do, and maybe I\\'m just too stupid or too old - or maybe I\\'m just painfully aware that our time on THIS planet (Earth) is way too short to waste it on badly designed prototypes like NO MAN\\'S SKY. \\n\\nI really appreciate that the team have been sticking this one out. I love that three years after it\\'s original (flawed) release in 2016, they\\'re bringing out major upgrades in this game for free. They\\'re tirelessly working on their original vision, they\\'ve been under huge scrutiny for years, and they\\'re still in business. They haven\\'t given up, and I give them 10 out of 10 stars for hanging in there. \\n\\nI feel reminded of Mass Effect Andromeda, whose team knew early on that they\\'ve built a lemon, and very quickly abandoned the project after release. Fix what you can, then cut your losses and move on. That\\'s what most humans would do, especially if there\\'s finance people involved. But Hello Games didn\\'t do that. They believed in NO MAN\\'S SKY, and they continue to believe in it. Besides, the graphics are beautiful. Photo Mode is extremely well implemented and a lot of fun to play with. We can take beautiful shots with this game in real time. The character animations are nice, the sound design is great, and I really get a feeling of abandoned loneliness on that one planet I was able to explore. I can imagine that had I gotten into it, this could have been a great long journey and an enjoyable experience for me, and my viewers alike.\\n\\nWhich is why is pains me to say that, without any discernible story, a terribly designed interface, and the complete non-starter experience I\\'ve made, I\\'m now so bored with the game that I can only abandon it and move on. Sorry team, it\\'s not for me. How many hours do you expect me to give you? Five? Ten? Twenty? Imagine investing that much time into a game and not getting anything in return? \\n\\nIf a game has \"mixed\" reviews, it means there aren\\'t just a couple of nut jobs out there who dislike it. It means you\\'ve not got the basics right. You\\'ve been focussing on things players are likely never to experience, and you\\'ve missed out on showing players what awaits them, or how to get there.\\n\\nRest in peace, NO MAN\\'S SKY.',\n",

Nice to know this before using so much time to figure it out, since it's a lot more to figure out at the same time.\\nI do not recommend this game because of the lack of information and how bad the building system is; making a base is tiresome and difficult, more than it needs to be, and with future tech; why the heck does it need to be so hard to store items in storages.. it's buggy and limited. \\nThis is an exploration game, it's not minecraft, shooter game, multiplayer, strategy, not even close to it. Even though it might seem like that they tried to make an alternative to something similiar here and there. It's an exploration game, and if you mainly don't like to take pictures of random generated stuff that makes no sense then don't buy it. I'm not recommending this game mainly because of all the bugs, I'm glad I was prepared for it searching forums in advance so when the bugs happened(because they will happen), I wasn't that let down.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The game starts out pretty good, lots of stuff to do, but once you build a base and trick it out there's only the story line and its boring. money is tight and you need lot's of it and I do mean lots BUT there is a simple solution. Buy oxygen at the stations, (really load up), and convert it to ionized cobalt.  If you sell it on a station that sells ionized cobalt, you can buy it back for 1/4 of the price and sell it at another station. I made enough this way to buy a ship with 39 cargo holds and make  7-8 million / sale. with 30 stations that sell ionized cobalt I can make a huge amount of money in an hour. BUT it takes a long time  for the economy to recover so I left the game open overnight and while I was at work and sure enough  prices recovered substantially. Once you get rolling with this there is no need to grind for anything except plant parts, just buy it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Even with so many updates, the fundamental of this game is still boring.  The walking around in this game should be the main selling points, but it felt really, really boring. The shooting, mining, and other things looked boring too. \\n\\nThe random generation thing doesn't do much for wonders. Sure you will get one or two cool looking planet, out of 10 you visited. Most of the planet you visited are just dessert and swamp that doesn't even look good. Colors feel muted, it's really, really rare to see that planet you see in screenshot or promotional material. \\n\\nNavigation in this game is a nightmare, things like car are unlocked later so you must use your plane to move a few meters away since running still felt pretty slow. Also, your plane needed propulsion fuel to take off, so after 4-5 take off you need to refuel it. Which mean more mining for things that you don't really want.\\n\\nTo entertain myself, I usually need to play a podcast and listen to music because it's just so boring. There not slight fun that you find in games like harvest moon, because there isn't really any goal to begin with. \\n\\nThreat? It's just some robot, scorpion, and that's it. Planet with lots of hazard usually have good material, but again, they are not good to look at.\\n\\nConclusion: They should fix the planet generation for this game, put a lot more sights, wonder, or anything to one planet is more appreciated than having bland 1000 planets.\",\n",

Multiple times I was losing hours of progress cause of BUG-s like crashing/being stuck in landing sequence and similar. Mind you game lets you save only in specific momments so any crash/issue when you need to reset your game is costing you progress. Tottal gamebreaker for me completly overshadowing how much they added to the game (Which doesn\\'t look that good anyway).\\n\\nMaybe some people got it to work after searching solutions throgh the forums for specific PC specs but even after doing that I coudn\\'t make it stable. It\\'s not like it should be my job to make game I paid money for work. I know I\\'m not the only player with that experience as forums are full of people describing multiple crash/stuck cases.\\n\\nIf you\\'re like me thinking you can give this game a try - be aware it\\'s a gamble at best in terms of sability and gameplay content was made \"ok-ish\" (if you\\'ll manage to avoid crashes). If I\\'d ignore crash problem I guess I could describe general content as \"mildly interesting\" but the price of this game has been too high for way too long. \\n\\nMaybe grab it when they\\'ll make some propper discount available like other game companies do with product that was out (in this case out and being \"fixed/made into something worth it\") since so long.',\n",

I play it casually for a few hours every update and never find the fun.\\n\\nAs a casual player, the only active changes I have seen are to offer food (pellets) to animals and the performance is fantastic (I don't do VR)!\\n\\nHere are some annoyances:\\nLiterally every single time you find anything interesting that joy is immediately killed by needing something else.  (I found a crashed freighter with 3 cargo pods! I couldn't open any of them because I don't have and haven't found any colbalt). \\nYou have a ship, but it costs special fuel to launch. I am constantly launching and landing just to reach one thing I saw on the visor.\\nWhile in low orbit, none of the visor icons appear so I just spent two hours looking for buried tech and trying to get close to it.\\nMoving on foot becomes a pain since my starting planet has high radiation. \\nI already started the base building tutorial so pulling a Patrick and just moving it somewhere else doesn't really work.\\nCannot move things once you build them.  You can only delete and get a portion of mats back so better not fuck it up.\\nYou can only tag one thing at a time despite this being a game about exploration. \\nThird-Person camera is just pointless (more than Bethesda's tpp)\\nThe menus are still just terrible, and the additional building and quick menus just make the problem worse.\\nYou need to be within arms reach of the ship otherwise you cannot transfer inventory. \\nStill never seen another player, but arguably the universe is pretty damn big.  \\n\\nHello Games is still trying, and that is fuckin respectable in 2019! I think my problem is, no matter how many changes they make, the core gameplay is just not fun in my opinion.\",\n",

The worlds are pretty diverse in flora, fauna, and color, though they severely lack in geographical diversity (no mountains, no massive cave systems, no canyons, etc). Building is well fleshed out and you can make very cool bases with a variety of structures and materials.\\n\\nSo, why do I not recommend the game?\\n\\nBecause the game still feels like it's in Beta. There are bugs, items that don't work, and missing features (like geographical diversity) 3 years since the game has been released. That item you just crafted? Sorry, there's a bug that doesn't allow it to be wired to power to actually use it. Those pirates you just killed for 200,000 bounty? Sorry, the game decided not to give you the payout. Your permadeath save? How about it gets ruined when you clip out of the space station into dead space and get killed by cosmic radiation?\\n\\nRewind the clock and it was only ever worse than it is now - more bugs and less features.\\n\\nThere is a lot of content there, but it is held back by a relatively monotonous progression, game-breaking bugs, and repetitive procedural generation of landscapes. \\n\\nI respect the amount of post-launch work the NMS Team has put into their initially broken product, but it's still definitely not worth $60. Maybe worth $20 or $30 on sale if you really really love exploration of infinite worlds and long crafting recipe trees.\\n\\nNot worth a cent if you don't fall into the above categories or want a seriously exhilarating game.\",\n",

On realizing exactly how pointless this game was, it literally made me question all the time I spend on all other games, questioning whether all were, on some level, an equally pointless waste of time and money. \\n\\nThe question I kept asked myself while slogging through No Man\\'s Sky was \"why\"? Look you can explore such crazy planets! \"Why?\" Look we have lots of animals! \"Why?\" Look you can buy new spaceships! \"Why\"? Look you can build a base! \"Ok but... why?\" And the answer to all of these questions really isnt clear. Sure you can buy a bigger space ship to make more money to buy bigger space ships to make more money to buy bigger space ships but at some point, it really hits you exactly how pointless that is. \\n\\nAnd once you have a big space ship and a base and have been to half a dozen crazy planets you inevitably ask yourself, \"what\\'s actually the point?\" And while this game has unquestionably improved since it\\'s release, offering new activities and content, it\\'s failed to add the one thing it\\'s needed most since launch: A POINT!

       "  'review': ' i played around 70 hours ( 69 actually ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) on steam plus couple more \"elsewhere\" and i feel like i\\'ve got all this game has to offer me. \\nFirst of all, congratulations to hello games. You guys really did something pretty impressive, you fixed a lot of the issues in the game, got more stuff into it and gave it a good polish. I really appreciate the effort that the company put into it; it must be pretty tough to see a lot of  memes and people making fun about something you\\'ve created. Making this game must\\'ve been exausting and really hard, being ambicious has its price. \\nI always loved space, star wars, rockets, ships (you get the picture) and when i saw the trailer for this game, i knew it was a dream coming to reality, finally i could explore space. I pre ordered this game and played in the very first day of launch, it was clunky, REALLY bad optimized, buggy and ugly... But for some reason, the feeling of exploring, the feeling of freedom and getting out of the atmosphere to reach space and see how small you are compared to the universe, it was magic and i kept playing no man\\'s sky for many hours.\\nAlthough games are, to some extent, forms of art as George R.R Martin himself said \"Games are almost art, they\\'re getting there\" they still need some specific aspects to be considered such. These aspects relate to visuals, experience, story etc. No man\\'s sky sure has visuals, they\\'re gorgeous when you\\'re out there in space as i said, the first contact with exploring the universe was magnificent. But that\\'s it, i felt like there was always something holding me from enjoying the game in a \"contemplative\" aspect or in a exploration aspect (must be because you need to refuel your suit every 30 seconds and you can only use your landing pads 4 times before you need to refuel them again, kinda breaking the cool part of the game and being a ship pilot going wherever the fuck i want+ the sentinels are a pain in the ass and not a challenge). But then they implemented a \"creative mode\" and still i couldn\\'t immerse myself in the space adventure for some reason, it felt just superficial again. The repetitive places and gameplay aspects that were just annoying were not enough to keep me playing for endless hours.\\nBut hey, there\\'s the OTHER side of this game that is less artistic and more practical. You grind (simple as that) and i feel like all i did was to try to find a decent system with a decent RNG and start mining or crafting stuff to sell. Don\\'t get me wrong i love grinding in some games, but here\\'s the catch: you grind because you want a nice reward; or let\\'s go deeper and say that you play games because you want to feel rewarded (that\\'s why rpg games are so addictive). In all my gameplay, didn\\'t feel rewarded at all, you can disagree and say that i played it the wrong way but that\\'s the truth, the sense of reward is way too low to become addictive and making me want to play again\\ni can\\'t recommend this game, but if you REALLY LOVE space exploration, space minecraft, RNG clusterfuck and you don\\'t really care about a low sense of reward... Give it a try, you might like it. \\nIf you want a space adventure with fair challenge, depth, high sense of reward and perhaps some cool grinding then you might need to wait for such a game to come out. \\nSorry for the long text\\nHello Games don\\'t give up, You\\'re in the right way. One day, with future updates i might change my mind and remove this review and recommend this game',\n",

So, you have to go back and delete more unwanted stuff. It's a miserable experience.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'EDIT: Even though I gave this a thumbs down, I still voted it for the \"Labor of Love\" award since it has come so incredibly far from it\\'s launch\\n\\n[b]No Man\\'s Sky is my favorite game that I don\\'t want to play anymore.[/b]\\n\\nHow\\'s that??  I guess that needs some explanation.  This is a game of extremes.  You have an infinite universe in front of you, but there only seems like there\\'s a handful of actual planets and the rest is all just slightly randomized. [b] I love being able to explore in games, and this gives you LOTS of stuff to explore and find and do on the planet surface. It really does keep you busy for quite a long time.[/b]  That\\'s probably the best part of this game.  However, after you\\'ve seen all the major planet types, there really isn\\'t much left in the way of exploration. \\n\\nThe SPACE side of this game actually kinda sucks in my opinion.  After playing Elite Dangerous and seeing a realistic universe portrayed the way I expect it, this game comes off as hollow with their planets all crammed within 5 minutes of each other.  Then there\\'s the fact that everywhere you go, there\\'s an asteroid field.  It doesn\\'t really make sense other than \"here\\'s an easy grind for a handful of materials that\\'s hard to get otherwise\".  I go to the asteroids and shoot stuff when I need Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Tritium... I can find Gold somewhat easily on planets, and Platinum rarely, but strangely I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever found a planet with silver on it.  Platinum is pretty rare too but I\\'ve at least seen that one.\\n\\nSpeaking of Space, the combat also really blows.  I am not a fan.  Combat is a chore and it feels like you\\'re flying the ship by holding a carrot on a stick for a goat that controls which way the ship actually points.   It feels sloppy, imprecise, and generally gets in the way.  It\\'s no fun for me so I generally try to avoid combat.  It\\'s not HARD because all the enemies die pretty quickly as long as you can manage to shoot them enough times, or if you\\'ve got some backup from your freighters, but it\\'s no fun and it feels like a chore.\\n\\nThere\\'s trading to be done, but that too doesn\\'t feel like it belongs in this game, especially when you buy something and find out you have to carry it in stacks of 5 and so you can only hold 40 of them because you don\\'t have enough slots left. I should be able to fill a cargo ship with whatever I want (within reason) and sell it without worrying about hearing the dreaded \"[i]NO FREE SLOTS IN SUIT IN-VEN-TREE[/i]\".   \\n\\nI heard enough of that in the first 30 minutes of playing the game.  Highly annoying and reminiscent of those games where they fill your pockets with trash as an obstacle...mostly because they do.  Several chests you find have \"rusted metal\" that you have to put in your pockets (or ship, or exocraft, or freighter, but you MUST TAKE IT before you can throw it away) and sometimes after taking the crap metal I have to stop, throw it away and then open the chest again to get to the REAL contents.  That is not fun.  That\\'s annoying as hell. \\n\\nThen we have the story in this game.  You have to find out the lore in bits and pieces through various terminals and oracles and shrines, and talking to people and so on, and that\\'s fine I guess, but the story itself isn\\'t exactly riveting.  There\\'s actual missions you can take that advance parts of the story more directly and that\\'s not exactly riveting either.  I\\'d give the Story 3/5.  It\\'s passable at best...and that\\'s when the game works properly.\\n\\nWhile we\\'re talking about that, this game crashed a lot on me, or if it doesn\\'t crash, stuff just doesn\\'t work right.  Or if it works right, it\\'ll stop working right later for no reason.  As an example, after a long game session, I\\'ll open one of the giant inventory boxes they make you put up so you can store more junk, and I\\'ll have plenty of space for something but I\\'ll click on the item and it\\'ll tell me \"INVENTORY FULL\" in that robo-voice, and I had no idea why... but I found out.  Somehow two items get stuck into one slot but it only shows the top item.   \\n\\nExample:  I see Phosphorous in the storage, so I click on it and it tells me I can\\'t take it... I clear out as much room as possible and try to take something else, which works just fine, but then I go back for the phosphorous and lo and behold, something else jumps into the now-free slot (maybe ferrite dust? Maybe something else) and I\\'ll be thinking \"where did that stuff come from?\"  Apparently out of the 5 slots they give you per storage unit, sometimes 6 items get shoved in there and then you can\\'t take from it until room is made for the 6th item to pop out. Weird.\\n\\nThere\\'s also numerous times when quests will just screw up on me.  It\\'ll tell me to see someone to start a quest, and then upon starting it, it\\'ll immediately tell me I am done even though I did nothing and did NOT fulfill the quest at all.  Then it might hang up and not allow me to progress any further or it might just skip over something crucial and leave me wondering why everything is broken now?  There\\'s an option somewhere to restart some of these quests but it really is annoying and doesn\\'t seem to work for all quests.\\n\\nSo I can see you\\'re reading all of this and thinking \"Why the hell did you even buy this game?\"  Well, honestly, I bought it for the VR support.   This game didn\\'t interest me at all until VR and that\\'s where I started playing it and started to really enjoy the exploration aspect.  I actually spent like 6 hours in VR at a time JUST in this game, but they were pretty frustrating hours... mostly because some of the controls in VR are even worse than they are in the pancake version, but also because some stuff just flat out doesn\\'t work in VR.   \\n\\nExample: I can\\'t rename anything in VR... for a long time one of the multi-tool weapons didn\\'t work in VR (I think they fixed that now), flying a ship in VR is made more frustrating by the fact that your hands can get \"glued\" to the stick and you want to move your hand away for some reason but instead you wind up pulling hard on the stick.  I think I had to squeeze the grip again to get it to quit.  Other times I\\'m able to disengage by just moving my hand far enough away, but flying in VR is even less fun than flying on the pancake version and that\\'s really a shame.  \\n\\nSo a quick rundown for those who don\\'t want to read all of that:\\n+ Planet exploration is great (at first at least)\\n- Space exploration sucks \\n+ learning the lore and language is neat but kinda tedious (so it\\'s a bit of a negative after a while)\\n- Quests screw up all the time and if you can\\'t restart it then it may just break everything.  \\n- combat sucks in almost every form but mostly space combat....The terrestrial stuff at least sorta feels like a FPS.\\n+ VR is super neat and the best reason to own this game\\n- VR is/was/probably will always be kinda buggy and more trouble than it\\'s worth on lots of different aspects of the game\\n+ Lots of story to play through\\n- But the story isn\\'t that interesting.  You may like it but I think I spotted the \"twist\" a long time ago and it\\'s not that new or original...but keep in mind that I never finished it because ultimately (original or not) I found it rather boring.  Again, you may like it.\\n\\nThis review is a mess....but that\\'s somewhat fitting for this game which is also a hot mess.  I feel like they started off with a grand concept that was unfinished (which bit them in the ass when everyone found out), then they added on to it in ways that helped to flesh it out but don\\'t feel like they were entirely planned, or not well planned anyway.  Now years later, the game is bigger and better than it was, but the code is probably a big spaghetti tangle and pulling one thread to unravel a bug knots 3 more in its wake.\\n\\nIf you have a lot of free time and patience and you don\\'t mind a sub-par story, but you love base building, and playing online with friends, this might still be worth it for you, but it\\'s not for me.  Sorry folks',\n",

       "  'review': 'I loved this game i really did. I was super hype for the big update they released last year. Me and a friend woke up super early to download and play the update. This new update, has absolutely destroyed the stability of the game and over a month after launch its still broken for me and my friends. I understand for some they game has been fixed, and we all know when this update came out it REALLY screwed the game up. \\nHowever on my end and my friends ends, the game is literally unplayable. I cant even begin to go into details on what is wrong but i can simplify it to constant falling through stations, crashes, poor performance, constant glitches and bugs, ETC. I dont mind the game getting updated and wiping my save everytime, i dont mind the fact its still being developed and will have some issues. I dont mind when my game crashes from time to time. I do mind where its at the point where i literally cannot play the game anymore.\\nI dont suggest this game for that reason alone that you could be one of the people who buy this, boot it up, and realize your game is also broken and it cannot be played. I applaud the developers still updating this game and what they have added is nothing short of amazing. They truly are putting everything into this. I hope that it is fixed someday because id love to play this again.',\n",

       "  'review': 'My heart races as I anticipate exploring the next planet in the next solar system in the vast universe. How long will they make me fly in a straight line this time before I am plunged into the next warp screen opening a canvas to the next breathtaking barren world filled with colossal amounts of empty space? What color will the wasteland be this time? Will I finally stumble across the purple watered, blue landed paradise filled with flying spiders and giraffe rabbits? How many dozens of warp screens will I watch before the time I spent watching them equals the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy and all of the special features? Its questions like these that make me feel like the heroic explorers of the past and allow me to ponder of the infinite possibilities of what I could have done with all the time spent watching those numerous warp screens.\\n\\nI loved walking slowly to my ship and flying through a warp load screen off planet then flying into a space station with a docking cut scene while I slowly walked to the teleporter in the space station for a warp load screen in space to get to my space base to stash supplies very slowly into my extremely limited inventory space so that I could slowly walk back to the teleporter on my space base and warp load screen back to the space station to sell slowly sell off my very limited inventory space for space units in a space merchant system designed by the same psychotic people who patented robot telemarketing and the space between your car seat and center console big enough for change and phones to fall into, but not big enough for a hand to fit into.\\n\\n Afterwards I fondly remember slowly teleporting from station to station to station, always greeted by the familiar comfort of the LSD infused warp screen, to go from one stereotype alien to the next and dredge through their merchant page to slowly spend my space units on upgrades, weapons, and the materials needed to explore deeper into this vast world of loading screens. \\n\\nMy pupils involuntarily dilate at the thought of continuing the adventure of exploring the planets ranging from any of the colors from the 64 color box of Crayola crayons and exploiting them for resources. The adrenaline pumping actions of squeezing my left mouse button down as the laser from my space laser very very very slowly extracts minerals from trees and rocks to trees that look like rocks so that I can slowly fill my very very very limited inventory space before I slowly walk back to my ship and fly through a warp screen to a space station and watch my favorite docking sequence and.....well....I think you the reader can guess what happens next ;-). \\n\\nNo Man\\'s Sky is truly an introspective game that lets you discover yourself and feel the energy of the universe flow through you. I loved how the developers really made an effort to make the player sit through warp screens at every possible occasion to give you time to make you wonder things like: \"what am I doing with my life?\" \"Why am I doing this?\" \"why do I exist?\" \"what does it all mean?\" \\n\\nIf I could go back in time, to a time before I played No Man\\'s Sky, I would probably die instantly from having to watch 1 more space loading screen from going back in time. \\n\\nDon\\'t ever play this game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"(note: I do not play multiplayer, nor do I play in VR)\\n\\nNo Man's Sky tries to do everything, but is shallow in every aspect. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE.\\n\\nExploration: The first several planets are interesting with weird animals and plants. After visiting a dozen planets, you'll find that they are mostly the same. All radioactive planets have the same aesthetics; all frozen planets have he same kind of trees; all toxic planets are inhabited by the same type of flora. And because there are only several type of planets, you'll find this 'sameness' show up very quickly. The type of fauna is quite limited as well. After five to ten planets, you'll see animals repeat over and over. For a game supposedly about exploring an 'infinite' universe, it's a huge weakness. And there's a thing that grates me and a lot of people: plants and animals pop in right in front of you, appearing out of thin air and instantly ending your suspension of disbelief. It somehow got far worse in the newest update.\\n\\nCreature interaction: You can ride creatures or gain their food products after feeding them. The novelty will fade off pretty quickly. You can't keep them as pets; they'll despawn if you move far away from them.\\n\\nResource management: It only serves to interfere with the 'exploration' aspect of the game. Gathering resources involves standing there shooting a beam at rocks and plants, which is boring as heck. Why do you need to gather resources in an 'exploration' game? Because you'll need them to recharge your hazard protection unit, life support, starship engine and warping system. It's not a challenge; you become kind of immortal after 10 minutes of gameplay (unless you are careless of course). But it forces you to constantly pause your exploration and fiddle with those sodium, oxygen, di-hydrogen, etc.\\n\\nInventory management: The most important gameplay loop of No Man's Sky is not exploring planets; it's expanding the inventory of your exosuit to reduce the tedium of resource management. But it is itself tedious. You expand your inventory by visiting space stations and ground based 'drop pods'. The former can only be used once per star system, forcing you to warp to a lot of systems; the latter requires an expensive item to even be found, after which asks you to gather a lot of resources before being usable. And you'll need to do this tedious task EIGHTY-THREE times before having a full inventory!\\n\\nStarships: They are functionally the same. They may look different but even your starting ship can do everything a high level ship can do (space combat, flying from to planets, from system to system, etc. ). The only difference is the number of inventory slots.\\n\\nSentient Aliens: They inhabit the whole universe for some untold reason; their buildings scatter around almost every planet, but cities are weirdly absent. There are three cliched races: traders, explorers and warriors, which you see in every sci-fi work. They supposedly have a rich and turbulent history, but your interactions with them do not reflect this, save for some cliched lore text dump.\\n\\nCombat: You fight two types of enemies: ground based sentinels and space pirates. They're basically about who has higher DPS. There is no nuanced strategy. You stand there (or sit in your spaceship) and shoot at the enemies until they die.\\n\\nBase building: It's acceptable, but nowhere as good as in Minecraft. To access base parts you need hundreds of 'salvaged data' which are scattered around surfaces of planets and take up dozens of hours to gather, before you can do anything meaningful in construction. The customization possibility is low because you only use prefabs, not blocks like in Minecraft.\\nThey recently introduced a power system. Again, it's rudimentary, far worst than the Minecraft redstone system. A big functioning base require a huge amounts of solar panels, which interferes with the aesthetics of big bases. \\n\\nFreighters and frigates: You can build a mobile base on your own freighter, but it's as shallow as ground-based base building. You can send out frigates to do missions, but the planning you do is absolutely minimal. You can't decide which star system to go, which planet to explore. It's as exciting as watching paint dry.\\n\\nStory missions: Completely lack depth. You go somewhere, interact with someone while looking at some text lore, do something (like gathering x amount of resources or killing x enemies) at their request, and report back to them. The presentation and content is so bad that I do not care about the protagonists at all.\\n\\nCooking: The newest update introduced cooking, which is fine. But what do you do with those finished foods? You either eat them to recharge your life support or give them to an NPC for some currency. You can't even put them as items into your own base!\\n\\nAnd last but not least: Bugs and performance!\\nOh man, the bugs in this game are numerous and never-ending. The developers seem to have a talent of introducing bugs with every major update. The performance of the game is absolutely horrendous.\\nYou can clip through freighters making you suspended in outer space, forcing you to reload.\\nFeeding creatures can crash the game.\\nFPS drop to 10-15 in small bases; it gets even lower in large bases.\\n\\nOnce again, do not buy this shallow game. You'll regret it.\\nIf you want a survival/crafting game, get Subnautica.\\nIf you want a game about construction and creativity, get Minecraft.\\nIf you want a game about exploration, combat and story, get the Witcher III.\\nDO NOT BUY NO MAN'S SKY.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m so sick of hearing people call this game in its original or even Beyond state \"excellent\"; it\\'s not. It has a brilliant core concept that was executed brilliantly... but then much of everything else is just mediocre at best. It lacks polish and refinement, and it desperately lacks bug-fixing. The UI is a horrid holdover from appliance-type hardware that can no longer even play the game well, and there are far too many WTF! moments with unexpected or unintuitive mechanics, like building blocks that don\\'t fit together seamlessly.  Planetary exploration is a lie, because the motivation for exploration is to DOCUMENT what is discovered and be able to RETURN to those discoveries.  Neither the documenting nor the returning is possible in this game, because all mapping and cartography tools have been denied the player, even those available to a 15th Century explorer.  Every visit to a planet is playing a blindfolded game of pin the tail on the donkey.\\n\\nWas Hello Games\\' ill-advised obsession with adding multiplayer gameplay directly responsible, or is Hello Games just irresponsible with the \"chore\" of bug-fixing and refining the game mechanics to evolve it from mediocre to excellent?  Whatever the reason or excuse, this game consistently leaves players wanting much more than it delivers, and who desperately want to love the game but wind up hating \"all the little things\" that aggravate them as they play.\\n\\nWith regard to the belated addition of multiplayer features, ask yourself this: does \"making it a threesome\" ever really fix a bad marriage?  No.  The underlying faults and issues are still there.  Such it is with this game; the faults and mediocre gameplay are still there, unresolved and unrefined, and sharing that mediocre gameplay with others doesn\\'t make it less mediocre.',\n",

A handful of galaxies will represent the majority of the planet types. \\n\\nBase building was more enjoyable before the Beyond update. Having to use the awful survey visor to find power then building generators and ugly wires ruins the casual fun of base building before the update. Underwater base building is fun for a moment until you realize that every ocean on every planet is quite shallow and the same. \\n\\nThe Nexus part of Beyond showed promise of a more interesting multiplayer, but did not truly add anything significant. Playing with friends remains just building bases or flying near each other with very little interaction. \\n\\nOverall I wont deny that they have built a massive array of galaxies, fauna, and flora but the novelty wears thin quickly. I may check out the game again after the next big update, but that is about the only chance it will be reinstalled.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Sure, it's true that they've put a lot of work into this game and yes, it has been improved by its updates but raving reviews by fans are different from what it's like to play. I've played it on and off since launch and I don't recommend you get into this game unless you really don't have anything else to do.\\n\\nIt's buggy as heck. I'm no stranger to games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 that can become borderline unplayable very rapidly but without any mods NMS might drop you through a fake floor, send you flying into space, delete items you spent hours crafting, or even forget your entire base. That kind of instability could have been excusable for the first year, but it's three years later and I'm getting bugs that I could have sworn were solved years ago.\\n\\nEven if you can get past the general atmosphere of instability, VR is so disappointing. Not that it's inherently bad, but that it could be so much better. Loading up the game in VR might make your controllers disappear, button prompts vanish, or nothing might happen at all as HG didn't set default controls. When it works, it makes all the bugs feel so much worse as you'll see what the game could be and what HG sorta wants. And when it doesn't work, you'll just feel heartbroken as you watch your prized ship vibrate back and forth before exploding.\\n\\nOverall, I've spent over 75 hours in the game. It's obvious that I enjoyed it enough to keep playing, but when I think back, I can't figure out why I spent so much time here instead of playing anything else.\",\n",

I like playing time consuming games but this i just could not spend enough time to stay attached. npcs are still bad, I hate the story, and what is the point in doing all this, its not worth 60$ before or now, it has been three years and my disappointment is so high that it took them to fulfill their promises and still charge at a non sale time for 60$',\n",

       "  'review': 'Straight to the point review, seems great at first with loads of potential with excitement of whats to come. Besides the big hype for all of these \"MAJOR UPDATES\" there isn\\'t that much to do other than grind and build a bases and upgrade your ship with many bugs constantly ruining it such as falling through the floor and some game breaking bugs.\\n\\nFor detailed breakdown.\\n\\n20 hours in, find all you\\'re really doing is grinding like an mmo but unlike something such as world of warcraft you dont get the reward of using the gear you grind for to raid with friends etc but you hope something is going to come from it and its building upto something. Also as mentioned above there are many bugs that make the experience very frustrating.\\n\\n\\n30 hours in - Find out there isnt really any real challenge its just about grinding and progressively getting more material to get better equipment so you guessed it. You can grind for even more.\\n\\n40 hours in - Repeat of the previous but finally bored of it and realise nothing is actually coming from the grinding may aswell waste my time doing it on an mmo as at least can do that with friends. There is multiplayer on no mans sky but its basically like youre both playing your own single player game and doing very little together as you can\\'t build bases together or use each others ships and most quests are done solo.\\n\\nThe most unique thing I found in this game is that sh*t is called faecium and is an element you can sellwhich I found amusing. Without spoiling the ending to the game (which is the main reason I stopped after a friend told me and I lookedi nto it to confirm)\\nWill likely make you think its the most retarded ending to a game youve ever known as without spoling it undoes alot of your hard work so you can you\\'ve guessed it grind even more.\\n\\nI rate this 3 out of 10 faecium',\n",

I almost enjoy the base-building stuff, and could probably learn to like it, although it's a bit opaque.\\n\\nUnfortunately it's largely gated behind a really infuriating inventory-management minigame which wastes my time by forcing me to manually discard things I (hope I) don't want.\\n\\nManually recharging my life support systems with a stack of gases from my magic gas pockets doesn't improve immersion, and having a single unit of Oxygen fill an inventory slot that could otherwise store a metric tonne of sheet steel doesn't constitute an interesting optimization problem.\\n\\nTrading off suit slots between storage and functional modules actually [i]could[/i] be an interesting optimization problem, but I don't think it's well expressed by the current tile-shuffling inventory (weight, volume and/or power limits might work). There isn't even a way to swap the contents of two tiles, so you need to empty one before you can laboriously move things around, like a sort of rubbish Towers of Hanoi split over six or seven different tabs.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Worst game I had in a long time.\\nIt promises so much and it deliver NOTHING.\\nI gave this game a fair chance. Almost 80 hours worth of chance. No. It\\'s still bad. There\\'s no part in this game what can be considered any kind of \\'good\\'. \\n\\n[h1]It\\'s poorly done.[/h1]\\nIt have a hint of three billion different gameplay mechanics, and none of them is developed to any sorts of depth. They just stays as a hints. Like you playing early alpha or something. And that\\'s after few major updates!\\n\\n[h1]The Universe[/h1]\\nIt promises endless universe with billions of solar systems... But they all the same. After you visit 10 or so planets - you\\'ll get bored. There would be hills with randomly scattered mineral nodes and tries. \\n\\n[h1]Planetary exploration[/h1]\\nEvery planet have exactly ONE biome. From pole to equator and back to pole again - every planet would look exactly the same as the place where you first landed. And there is less then 10 noticeably distinct types of planets.\\nOn most of the planets - there\\'s buildings. And, as you might have guess, there\\'s about 10-15 distinct planetary structures. Throughout whole universe, yes, not just the planet. All of them - standalone structures, just scattered randomly. No cities, no infrastructure - just random buildings in the middle of the great nowhere. Almost all planets have almost all types of structures on them.\\n\\n[h1]Ground Combat[/h1]\\nIs... boring. On every planet there\\'s Sentinels. 4 types of them. Yes, 4 types throughout the endless Universe. It\\'s a Drone, Armored Drone, Doggo and a Walker. They come in waves and after you defeat  one wave, in a less then a minute game will spawn next, stronger wave. After you defeat strongest wave... it will spawn it again. Ad infinitum. And yeah, \"strongest\" means two armored drones, two doggos and a walker. After you get hang of it, defeating them is not a really big deal. Just annoying. When you tired of fighting you could always jump into your spaceship and zip away. There would be no consequences. Oh you could hide in the burrow, they will search you for a minute and then forgot what you ever existed.\\nThere\\'s also Zerg-like creatures, what pose a bit of threat, but you could notice their nest from a mile and they never attack unprovoked. Yeah.\\nAnd even if you die... You\\'ll be respawned at your starship, which is probably parked fifty to two hundred meters away. Because the\\'s no any sensible way to get to that location without your spaceship in the first place. That\\'s HARDCORE, man.\\n\\n[h1]Space Combat[/h1]\\nEven more boring. And more annoying, because here you\\'ll get attacked from time to time and could not escape before killing everyone. Also, you could recharge your shield for resources and for kills, and your opponent does not have any shields at all. I never died in space. Your HUD is also super useless, so you fight in 3D almost blind. But more on that later.\\n\\n[h1]Resources[/h1]\\nThere\\'s gazillion different resources, and most of them - useless. They exist just craft one or two things which you probably never ever would craft in the first place. because they are also useless. It would\\'t be such a big issue, but you have extremely limited inventory space. And you have no way of telling, which resources are essential and which is just a garbage. Because it\\'s so inconsistent.\\n\\n[h1]Chemistry[/h1]\\nAt first it just leave bad taste in my mouth but then then it became epiphany. It\\'s just describes whole game/ It\\'s so inconsistent, it makes your brain hurt, it\\'s dead wrong and it\\'s weird.\\nFirst of all, it\\'s called \\'refining\\'. And it starts as a quite promising feature, but goes sour really fast.\\nYou have qute a few elements. Things like Oxygen, Nitrogen, Radon, Cobalt, Carbon, Tritium... Each one of them have a corresponding symbol from periodic table. GOOD. But most corresponding resource icons have some variation of generic pop-culture image of an atom, from the guy, who never had a chemistry class in his life. Just bad attention to details, you say. It is. But it gets worse.\\n\\nIron called \"Ferrite\". Why? \\n\\nHydrogen called Di-hydrogen. Why?! Why there isn\\'t things like di-oxygen, di-nitrogen then? All those gases prefer to exist in di-form. Which means what they are naturally forms molecules like H2, O2 and N2, correspondingly. Also, this di-hydrogen have an icon what better suited for deuterium. But they have deuterium. And it have an icon of two di-hydrogen \\'thingies\\'. AAAAAH! Awesome level of scientific literacy for Sci-Fi game. Yet the Tritium have an icon which is acceptable for Tritium. Consistency!\\n\\nCarbon Dioxide called Dioxite. What. Yes. This word does\\'t even exist, and they have lots of fictional compounds, but they choose to slap CO2 formula on it. WHY?!\\n\\nBut it\\'s get worse.\\n\\nBecause there\\'s...\\n\\n[h1]Refining[/h1]\\nIt called refining, but in fact it\\'s transmutations. Things are completely unpredictable there. It follows no logic, it makes no sense.\\n\\nOkay, you get Ferrite, you combine it with Oxygen, and you get... Rusted Metal. Fair enough.\\nNow, equipped with this knowledge you take Oxygen, combine it with Hydrogen and you get... Yeah, you guessed it, Sodium Chloride. You still with me? Breathe.\\nOkay, now it\\'s a bit easier. \\nYou could refine Sodium Chloride into Chlorine gas. Fine. Sodium is much more valuable resource in the game, but okay.\\nBut now you could combine Chlorine with Oxygen. And no, there\\'s no chlorine oxides in the game, thankfully.\\nFor one unit of Chlorine and two units of Oxygen you\\'ll get... bear with me... six units of Chlorine. Yes. You quite literally creating things from thin air here.\\nAnt everything is like that. You need carbon nanotubes to make microprocessors. WHY?! What carbon ever have to do with microprocessors? \\nTo make Circuit Board you need bunch of fruits what you could reliably get in desired quantities only from really extensive farming.\\nJust... NO. God. Ugh.\\n\\n[h1]Interface and Navigation[/h1]\\nI could continue on, and on, and on. Every, and i mean it, EVERY gameplay mechanic there ether broken or so shallow and undeveloped, it have no right to be in a finished product. But i guess I said more then enough already.\\nBut this thing have to be addressed.\\nThe interface in the game there just to annoy hell out of you.\\nThere is no map.\\nThere is no planetary maps.\\nThere is no solar system maps.\\nThere is no galaxy map. Last one not exactly true, but call this assortment of random nondescript dots a map is also a bit of stretch.\\nNavball in your starship is all but useless on a planet. In space it\\'s pretty much useless as well. And that\\'s the only navigation tool you have. Enjoy.\\nIt seems like there\\'s no way to look around inside your cockpit without VR-set. And in some cockpits navball and information screen just outside of your field of view. Enjoy.\\nYou cannot call the other ships. If you want to communicate, you should get close to that ship and wait for them to call you. Neat.\\n\\nBut i saved my favorite for the last.\\nYou could exchange navigational data for planetary chart on a space station. It\\'s the one of few ways to navigate on a planets. Well, \"navigate\". Planetary chart will point you nearest random building on a planet, so you could participate in some random encounter. Yes, it\\'s as useless as it sounds.\\nSo to obtain a planetary chart you should first obtain some nav-data. It\\'s not a problem, it\\'s everywhere, but it takes your precious inventory space.\\nSo, you at cartographer.\\n[olist]\\n[*]Start conversation with a cartographer\\n[*]Listen to his greeting message\\n[*]Wait for dialog options to appear\\n[*]Choose according dialog option\\n[*]Listen to his lengthy reply\\n[*]Wait for the game to return controls to you \\n[/olist]\\nCongratulations, you just exchanged ONE nav-data for ONE chart. Oh, you want two charts? Do it all over again. You want 5? You don\\'t want that, trust me.\\nBut there is an icing for a cake. There\\'s multiple flavors of charts. And there\\'s no way to know in advance which type of charts this cartographer provides.',\n",

       "  'review': 'After 3,500 hours of playing the game since Foundation (don\\'t worry! 2,500 of them is AFK farming during Atlas Rises. I have a life!), I can say I\\'ve quite enjoyed it for the most part, with the definition of most being 50.000000000000000000000000000001% of the time. And usually that\\'s doing relaxing walks on my home planet.\\nBut there are really, really annoying and aggravating things that prevent me from recommending the game just yet. Mainly the nerfed exploration (BIG ONE), the frustrating base building, those damn sentinels, the little things and the TONS of damage, I mean BUGS.\\n\\n1 - There are just TEN different kinds of terrain generation in a game with quintillions of planets, and each planet/moon can have just ONE. This is fine before NEXT when the landscapes can get really magnificent, but NEXT made it feel rather same-y after just a few planets or moons. Why not combine two or more of them for more variation? Same thing with the biomes too. Some planets can have just one terrain or biome while others can have two or more. Or maybe bring back the old terrain generation to some planets. (City planets or planets with village-like settlements please, though that\\'s probably just a dream hahahaha)\\n\\n2 - Colors are seriously nerfed. Not counting the mega-exotic planets, there are just 6 sky colors. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, pink. There are just 4 colors of water - Red, yellow, green and blue. In lush planets, there just 7. Red, yellow, brown, blue, green, violet, pink. Maybe 8 with the rare white grass. How about using more (like way more) color combinations so all planets will feel more unique?\\n\\n3 - Flora and fauna levels. What happened to this? Before NEXT, planets have varying levels of flora and fauna. I used to see planets that have barely any flora but lots of fauna, while others are lush forests with no fauna. No noise. Just peace and quiet in that planet. Now, all non-dead planets have lots of flora - the variety is dramatically lessened. Why!\\n\\n4 - I\\'m seeing almost, if not the same kind of fauna in almost every planet/moon I come across. It was a bit more varied before NEXT. Out of the several hundred, probably over a thousand planets I\\'ve explored, 95% of it have the same cow-like, rat-like, dog-like whatever creatures. It gets old real quick. The noises need to be more varied as well. It\\'s the same set of animal noises for every fauna. The same. The birds and flying worms don\\'t make a sound either. Just a dream: Bring back the sandworm.\\n\\n5 - I don\\'t know why, but building a base, especially larger ones, is FRUSTRATING. To me, it\\'s not the power system - I\\'m probably in the minority that likes it. It is how annoying and sometimes, difficult it is to place base parts. Some even require multiple weird steps to make, like stair \"railings\". Others will be \"invalid\" or something due to Atlas knows what. The ability to minutely rotate objects with the mouse wheel is also lost. Can\\'t just everything snap easy-peasy and validly so we can more easily build stuff. We can easily delete a wrongly placed floor tile or wall, instead of dealing with the annoying invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid oh my goodness why is the wall having a seizure invalid invalid invalid invalid everything? Or maybe add an angle-adjusting function so we won\\'t resort to glitch building all the time?\\n\\n6 - Sentinels. These things are A PLAGUE, those drones especially that make annoying machine sounds that vaguely resemble evil laughter. Just mining a tiny 1 yoctometer-sized rock alerts them. Their AI and the manner they spawn both seriously need reworks as they are a manifestation of annoyance. A REAL ANNOYANCE SO ANNOYING, EVEN YERSINIA PESTIS IS SCARED OF BEING ANNOYED AND PESTERED BY THEM PESTS. Sure I can just keep distance and watch them stupidly wonder what the heck is going on, but a lot of times, especially in survival mode, THEY JUST APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU WHILE DESTROYING TINY ROCKS WHICH MAKES THEM MAD AND GO PEW PEW.\\n\\n7 - Bugs. In the Beyond update, there are so many bugs, it\\'s insane. Why does every update, especially the big ones, have to be infested with colonies of bugs? Considering how huge the game is, updates having several bugs is fine. It can take a patch or 5 to fix. But several colonies of bugs? Some of which are so darn persistent they reincarnate to a different bug when they die? Err... what\\'s going on? Why release updates in such a bug-infested state?\\n\\n8 - The little things. OH BOY there are a lot here. When firing your weapon, instead of instant response, sometimes the avatar will twitch the gun for a second before firing, even if the weapon is already drawn. This has screwed me many times in intense battles against sentinel walkers and quads. Ship handling can still get unpredictable and twitchy, even in fighters with a full suite of S-class pulse engine upgrades. Pirates asking for just 10,000 units even if I have 200 Stasis Devices (worth about 3 billion units) in my starship. Enemy starships going through freighters. Pulse jumping to the rear of my freighter, only to clip through the engines and get stuck. Not getting any damage from Biologial Horrors as long as I hug the outside of an abandoned building\\'s wall, but I hope I won\\'t get clipped through or else I\\'ll reload my save and start collecting eggs again! Biological Horror spit dealing not that much damage. Lack of really powerful enemies, especially to players with S-class everything. Hostile fauna going through plants and birds and rocks and things when they want to eat me. Large refiners having portable capacity (250). Ceiling lights and floor lamps emit almost zero light. Not being able to swap items unless there is an empty slot. Why can\\'t I place a table in my base unless it\\'s the planet surface? Why are my base specialists\\' feet below the floor? Why is the wall invalid and having a seizure while building a base? Why is my FPS being flushed down the toilet as I\\'m flushing down myself and my starship down to the planet\\'s surface? The clouds don\\'t look as awesome as the one in the NEXT trailer. Why does every system have a ringed planet? Why do star systems always need to have life? I encountered star systems with nothing but dead planets in the past. I can\\'t evenly flatten the terrain with the terrain manipulator - I can just make holes or fill holes and hope that it is at least semi-flat. That small cutscene when using a manufacturing plant\\'s save thingy. Planet-wide storms occurring at regular intervals. Pirates attacking at regular intervals. Getting attacked by pirates in a supposedly uncharted system. My underground base being covered by terrain... yeah. Quite a lot and there\\'s more! But that\\'s what I have in mind right now. Anyways!\\n\\nAt its current state, even after playing the game for 3,500 hours, I still can\\'t recommend the game just yet. It still needs a lot more polish, tons more bug fixing, quality of life improvements and most especially, doing something about the exploration aspect. If Hello Games can at least nail the exploration aspect and call the most ruthless and merciless bug exterminator in existence, most of the more minor flaws, quirks and features will be set aside by most players. I wouldn\\'t mind a full-blown reset if that\\'s what it takes to get the exploration part right. And the bugs. They need to die.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my long \"review\" of the game!',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’m a sucker for these survival-craft-explore loop games, so I’ve been a sinking time into No Man’s Sky. It’s been a really mediocre experience through a supremely boring universe.\\n\\nTo be fair, I haven’t had an expressly terrible time in No Man’s Sky. It’s been alright. I keep booting the game up and bouncing around in space and from planet to planet, scanning procedurally-generated flora and fauna, shooting a mining laser to gain resources, and occasionally fighting pirates. I don’t really know why, because none of these activities are too fun. \\n\\nThe game feels almost really good, which is tragic. Basically every system I’ve touched, from base building to walking around space stations, has felt like a hollow shell of what could have been a really fun system. Almost everything feels like an unfinished system.\\n\\nI have to give credit to Hello Games for the sheer amount of continuous work they are putting into it. I looked back through the past few years of updates, and they’re definitely trying to flesh it out.\\n\\nThe problem is, it feels like I’m playing an MMO near the end of my subscription, going through the motions for no apparent reason, everything feeling incredibly repetitive. There’s no substance here, and the worst aspects of procedural generation are on display here. I can’t find much to praise. But, for whatever reason, I keep playing, because it’s an alright podcast game.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Still so broken! There is no logic to so much of it. Inventory management is so frustrating it has made me quit several times. Why does information only stack up to 5 and take up as much space as 10000 units of copper? In what universe does gold refine into pyrite FFS? There are so many items and resources that are needed in the beginning, yet they only give you a handful of \"slots\" to put them in.\\n\\nI was excited to find a new ship with much more storage, but then for some reason the ship I had just disappeared with all the resources on it I needed to fix the new one. How does a ship just disappear? I flew the thing there, but now it\\'s gone? So broken. So I\\'m stuck on a planet now with no way to fly out and get the resources I need to fix it.\\n\\nYou \"learn\" new alien languages by speaking to them one at a time and you get to learn one word from each. The process is painfully clunky, with unintelligable text scrolling ever so slowly that you have to click through again and again before you get the option to learn a random word like \"the\". So next time you speak to an alien of that race, it will be \"Blah blah blah the blah blah\". So helpful.\\n\\nThe combat is a joke. Your weapon lags and doesn\\'t fire often, the mobs are impossible to line up, aiming is a pain, but thankfully the mobs are unintelligent and even while bumping against your head they can\\'t seem to find you often. I\\'ll check in with this game again I guess when the next patch comes out to see if it has been fixed, but in the state it is in, calling it a beta would be generous. What I would really prefer is a refund.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m going to be blunt, this game is boring. \\n\\n\"At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos.\"\\n\\nTo me it was [i]very[/i] resistable. I didn\\'t care for the missing pilot, I just wanted his ship. I dont care about those people in the thing that just showed up, I just saw a cool looking planet. I didn\\'t feel like my character had a reason to do anything the game wanted me to do, except for refilling my hazard protection to survive. The NPC\\'s told me what to do, the little computer on my back told me where to go, oblivious to my wants and needs. Some parts of it made me curious, like the time I found some ruins on a planet and dug them out to receive some piece of treasure that\\'s only purpose was to be sold. Wasn\\'t some ceremonial item from civilizations passed, just something to make a space-buck.\\n\\nAll you\\'ll be doing, at the game\\'s core, is mining materials. It doesn\\'t matter [i]why[/i] you\\'re shooting that rock, you just know that it has what you need inside of it and you\\'ll be damned if you don\\'t get any of it. Then you get a bigger laser that lets you remove materials that your mining laser can\\'t. And when you\\'re out in space and not going to another planet or one of the similar-to-the-last-systems space stations or fleets, you\\'ll be shooting--you guessed it--, asteroids.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\" Yeah this isn\\'t true. I\\'ve see the same rocks on planets that are impossibly far apart, the only thing different being their stats that are only available when you scan something. My friend has commented several times about how he \"has the same animal on my planet!\" while walking past the same cave-plants I\\'ve seen in the last four planet\\'s caves.\\n\\nThe menus.. I don\\'t like it. I feel like it could have been done differently, and using right-click to go back on everything feels unintuitive, even with the icon telling me to right-click to go back, I still hit ESC and end up pausing the game. Maybe I\\'m just \\'special\\' in this aspect. I\\'m also not a fan of how things move along and opposite of my mouse when in the menus. I just don\\'t like it in games that have it, it doesn\\'t make the menu more interesting, just makes it harder to hit the buttons. Destiny also has this and I dislike it there, too. \\n\\nThe part I was most excited for was learning the languages. I was hoping I could discover various ruins of the different races, learn each of their varied pasts, actually [i]study them[/i].. Instead I get to look for cylinders with circles in them for [i]each[/i] race. Yep, each race stores their memories in the exact same obsidian blocks as the other races. I tried to like what they did where you could do different things in the memory, but it\\'s pretty much a \"yes\" or \"no\". All of the horrible things that happen to you are just visions, and the only option you should pick is \"wait it out\". \\n\\nNow you DO get to play with your friends now, and I\\'ll say the process is (mostly) smooth. Sometimes things don\\'t appear, occasionally trading doesn\\'t work, but the rest of the time it\\'s buttery smooth and I\\'ll say this game is definitely better with another person.\\n\\nShort and Sweet Version:\\n\\nYou\\'ll quickly see everything in the first couple of hours, you\\'ll be doing a lot of mining, and it\\'s almost tolerable with a friend.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I respect the hell out of what Hello Games has done to improve the state of this game. I played it at launch, and I played it again any time a major expansion released and each time it has gotten better and better. In its current state, there is much more to do, there are places to explore and a storyline to follow, and a \"point\" to gathering all of the materials: base building, upgrades, and more. For that, it is commendable - and I certainly appreciate a new space VR game to take some time out of Elite. \\n\\nBut this is still not a game that I can recommend. Hello Games has addressed the problem of there being nothing to do in the game but have failed to fix basic issues that keep turning me away from the game each time that I come back to it. These include: \\n\\n[list]\\n    [*] [b]Terrain pop-in.[/b] A game as massive as this will need to manage draw distance in some way, I understand that. What I cannot forgive is mountains and trees that change shape drastically several times as I fly toward them, or even worse appear out of thin air giving me no time to crash into them. Which leads me directly into: \\n    [*] [b]The wishy-washy flight model.[/b] Ships fishtail around in the sky and don\\'t differ meaningfully from each other in terms of handling, acceleration and features. Ships auto-accelerate and never fully stop, making it difficult to perform precise maneuvers. The game also babies you and tries its best to not let you crash into terrain. You have to be so precise with your aim in space combat that it is almost impossible to line up shots in a consistent manner. It just [i]doesn\\'t feel good[/i] to be in my spaceship in this game, whether in first or third-person view and in a game that is ostensibly about exploring the universe, this is unforgivable. To be clear: I don\\'t want Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen levels of realism in the flight model but I want to do ill-advised stunts through archways in the terrain, and juke enemies in an asteroid field and I want to do it all in a ship that feels responsive and accurate. \\n    [*] [b]The Color Palette and planet generation.[/b] Very, [i]very[/i] few planets that I have come across thus far have been interesting. Sure, there are neat plants and things to explore but 9/10 planets feel drab, lifeless, and marred by drastic color contrasts or uninteresting palettes. In the game I recently started, I went to a Red Planet, a Pink Planet, a Beige Planet, a Green Planet, another Red Planet, and finally another Beige Planet. None of them offered landscapes that were particularly interesting. Nothing I wanted to build a base on let alone explore for more than a few minutes to find the resources I need, and then get back off. Combined with the pop-in issues and generally unimpressive effects, textures and lighting I don\\'t ever want to remain planetside for longer than I have to. \\n    [*] [b]Performance Issues.[/b] My rig is running a Ryzen 3900X and a 2080 Ti with 16 GB of RAM. There should not be performance issues and yet when interacting with Knowledge Stones, entering atmospheres and at random points throughout the game I experience stutter, missed inputs and general frame drops. This isn\\'t in VR, it\\'s not in 4K, and my system usage isn\\'t maxing out when this happens either. \\n    [*] [b] Inventory Management.[/b] My God almighty this is unimpressive. The layout of your... what is it... six? seven maybe? separate inventories/technology layouts is unintelligible, clunky and difficult to manage on a controller. Simple as that, it\\'s bad. There have been updates addressing the most common QoL complaints but it needs a revamp from the bottom up to keep up with all the upgrades, separate materials and crafting components. It\\'s way too small and way too hard to manage. \\n[/list]\\n\\nI will keep coming back to No Man\\'s Sky every time there is an update. I really want this game to be great. I share Hello Games\\' vision of a \"Chill exploration experience,\" letting off steam laid back with my controller or with my headset captaining a ship through an exotic, surreal galaxy. But it cannot be [i]chill[/i] if I\\'m constantly managing my inventory. I don\\'t want to [i]explore[/i] when every planet is uninteresting and graphical glitches abound. And it\\'s not a good [i]experience[/i] when I don\\'t enjoy flying in my spaceship or dealing with performance issues. \\n\\nThis game is worth keeping up with, and not worth giving up on. I don\\'t think I ever will. I am impressed by how far it has come and am just waiting for that last extra step before I will enjoy it.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[b]Alright lets be honest here...[/b]\\nThe game has a great concept but the execution of it is less than stellar.\\n\\n[b]TLDR:\\nThe game is a great concept with poor execution. A game full of bugs, shallow story, shallow missions, shallow mechanics etc. It feels like an empty husk that looks cool from the outside.\\nI had fun with it but only because I had friends on discord to hang with while we playing it in separate instances because Multiplayer is a mess. The money and ship grind is the main time sink.[/b]\\n\\n\\nI played this game quite a while after the initial release and I had fun and now with the VR release I played it again at first it was fun but after a while you realize that all planets look very similar if not the same. \\nAlmost every single planet i went to had the oxygen plants that puff out toxic air and they had the cave rocks that also put out toxic air and not to mention the venus fly trap plant that hits you when you're not even close to it. \\nAll planets have the same looking buildings with the same looking aliens in them that say the same thing over and over. It's like taking to a kid that can only say 3 sentences.\\nAll trees look the same with different colors sometimes. \\nThe animals have a little bit of variety but in the end you're see the same hopping pineapple on a ton of planets as well. The animals also don't pose a single threat or have any interesting interactions to them at all. They feel like empty husks. Even if the animals are hostile to you they just run up to you and you get hit. But it's not really a threat.\\nEnvironmental damage like weather and such also poses no threat at all. Once again more of an empty husk.\\n\\nSo what we've established is that everything is essentially a shallow empty husk when it comes down to it.\\n\\n\\n[b]Lets talk about base building for a second![/b]\\nThe building in this game is not that great. There are instances where you'll think you should be able to place something down but it won't let you and that's just really frustrating. Like you can put railings in a certain spot next to stairs or you can't put stairs next to arches or you can't put a trading terminal on a wooden wall or the health and hazard modules you can put down don't work because it says you need power yet there is no way to hook them up to power.\\n\\nAlso when building in multiplayer the person who was at my base was not able to see the changes I was doing not to mention the lag you get when going to certain bases and I have a good rig to run games on.\\n\\n[b]I did try to build a couple bases and this is how it went:[/b]\\nI attempted to build a couple bases and my first base that I spent quite a while on was sunk into the ground when I came back one day totally ruining the build and I essentially had to delete it. Now I did not terraform anything to build this base so the bug (Is it a bug?) where the ground regrows in your base wasn't a thing here. It literally just moved underground and the top part was sticking out.\\n\\nThe second base I attempted to make also took me quite a while and I came back one day and it was tilted. It wasn't when I built it though. So that one got deleted. \\n\\nThe third base which I spent the most time on was amazing. But once again suddenly when I got back a terrain feature from that planet spawned in it and it wasn't there before. Not to mention the people I was playing with didn't even see it. It was only on my end. But that also ruined my base.\\n\\nAfter those 3 instances I honestly stopped trying... Imagine spending hours on a base just to have it ruined by bugs over and over again and you can't do anything about it.\\n\\n\\n[b]Lets talk about multiplayer now...[/b]\\nTrying to join someone in multiplayer is an actual nightmare... I would join someone and they wouldn't be able to see me. Ships that land at trading posts and space stations would have different stats for both of us. Sometimes ships would land in each other. \\nNexus group quests would be fun to do even though they're super easy and having a group for it isn't even needed at all but once you go back to try and turn it in you might get put in a different nexus instance essentially making it so you can't see each other anymore even if you go back to the same system and you'd have to go through the nightmare of rejoining again.\\n\\nLong story short is that my friends and I essentially had to play solo and just talk in discord for the most part instead of actually playing together because of the huge amount of bugs associated with it not to mention the lag when going to each others bases.\\n\\nOnce again Multiplayer is a empty husk of nothingness.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about ships, frigates and freighters?[/b]\\nShips and freighters is going to be your main time sink in this game. Finding a ship or freighter you like and then getting it in the highest class you can might take you 10 minutes or days. \\nMaking money for those ships might also take you quite a while unless you decide to use cheats, exploits or broken mechanics which a lot of people do. \\n\\nAs for frigates which are the small ships that come with freighters. You can send them on quests and get rewards for it. It's essentially a shallow mechanic. \\nNot to mention the fact that once frigates get damaged in a mission and they get back you might not be able to fix them so then you just have to delete them from your fleet so if you spent the time to find S class frigates you can say bye bye to your time spent and the money you spent hiring the frigate.\\n\\nWhat happened to me is that my frigates got back and I had to repair them. In order to do that you need to land on the frigate however the landing pads were broken meaning you couldn't land on them and therefor you couldn't repair them.\\n\\nYou also can't change colors on ships which lets be honest here should be a thing in a game like this specially after all this development time. Even a simple mechanic where you can re-roll a ships paint job through their random generation system for a fee at a space station or something would be good enough.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about mission? How about the story?[/b]\\nMissions are the same shallow missions over and over again that are super easy and honestly not worth doing. \\n\\nThe story is uninteresting and shallow. They just have you jumping all over the place to add game time and say it's content but in reality it's just padding in my opinion. In fact you might go through the entire story only to have your decision at the end bug out your entire game.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about flying and how about VR?[/b]\\nFlying around is pretty good once you get used to it and in VR it feels really nice to fly around. \\nI haven't had any motion sickness at all which is a very good thing. I have to give them credit for that one.\\nThe game however is very poorly optimized and not just for VR and still carries a lot of simple VR bugs with it at the writing of this review.\\n\\nThat being said the ship combat is once again not that great. it's the same thing over and over. Oh pirates want your stuff... Oh you won't give it to them? Lets have you spend some time killing these ships that don't pose a single threat what so ever and have nothing good for loot. They're just an annoyance.\\nI must say that ship combat in VR is a lot more interesting but in the end it boils down to the same thing.\\n\\n\\nThat's pretty much it.\\nThere are better games to spend your money on that aren't as shallow as this game is.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I had been interested in the game since release, but was kept away by early reports. With the new updates, improved multiplayer, and a lack of satisfying multiplayer exploration games, I bought No Man's Sky (along with my wife) after the Beyond update. Our initial efforts to play the game were plagued by problems. First and foremost among them, was a disassociation between what each of us was experiencing, despite being in game together. She would frequently get assaulted and killed by hostile animals, despite them being invisible and unaffectable to me. Similarly, I was overwhelmed by storms, while she saw clear skies. After a week of this sort of play, we threw our hands up in frustration. \\nIn an attempt to salvage the experience, I suggest we explore in Creative mode, and see what the game had to offer, and perhaps spend some time designing bases on worlds we liked the look of. Though this experience gave us a few more days of play, it was repetitive, unengaging, and generally a huge letdown.\\nI haven't explored this game in single player mode much, but after seeing the limits to what CAN be researched, designed, explored, and created, I have to say I can't imagine spending much more time in this game. The worlds, aliens, and missions are stunningly repetitive. Uncovering alien languages seems neat initially, but it is frustratingly slow (who learns new languages one word at a time?) and requires hearing the same alien dialogue over and over again.\\nI'm still hopeful that Hello Games will continue to upgrade and improve this game, but at this point in its iteration, it's decidedly underwhelming still. Even as a light exploration game, the act of navigating (the galaxy, the solar system, and the many worlds) is remarkably frustrating. This game still needs a ton of work.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I have over 40 hrs on the game and I'm still wondering, what's the appeal? I mean, there's nothing to do. All galaxies are the same ± some rare element. You get to do the same bounties over and over again. You don't even need a base. All upgrades to ship, multi-tool and exosuit are just + x% whatever you had. The price for ship and freighter are so high, you have to abuse crashing the economy of a system and buy/sell wiring loom to get money.\\n\\nThe game bug out on me every 2-3 hours. Graphic are meh and spaceship control are utter crap. I bought this to play with a friend, ends up the multiplayer is completely useless, the game is meant to be played singleplayer. \\n\\nSo, it's just not fun. OR maybe, just maybe, i've missed on something so important in the game wich would have blowned my mind and made me a NMS addict...\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The tutorial is a mess and you don't have time digesting the information the game is throwing at you. Once you manage to survive all of it, I figure it would be cool to make a base on a extreme cold planet since I did have a S class hazard protection module that allow me to be invincible in extreme cold. Wonder why it stop working after a while once I collect more of them, then learn it was a bug (that would trigger a annoying sonar sound) and were worthless, meaning all the time spending on the base was a waste. Why each upgrade have they own energy pool anyway? It just make thing more confusing and annoying to recharge in the quick menu.\\n\\nYou also have no way to buy the ship you want or to sell directly, meaning you have to sit idle in a space station or a trading post like a idiot and scan every ship one by one once they are landed (cause a space dealer is too much to ask apparently), finding a broken ship is not worth to repair, your better off repair it enough to make it flight capable and trading it for a fully fixed one, the grind for them is insane otherwise...Did I mention grind? this is all you will do for the whole game, to the point is hard to appreciate or have time exploring.  Finding a S class freighter also legitimately required dedication unless you cheese the free one, and even then is pure rng, it can take a few try to a few day and they is no reliable way to get one otherwise.\\n\\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg, the game is fill with bugs. I though ok maybe they are fixing it or just need time, but apparently, from what I read the dev made a few megatread for bug fixing and usually only fix like 10 of them on the whole list after a very long time, making them pointless and unlikely all the bug I am encountering will get fixed.\\n\\nI honestly feel all the hour I spend on the game was a waste of time to the point I regret buying this game.

You are not satisfied with less than perfect weapons and ships? Then this game is not for you. You need to spend a lot of time and many many retries to get what you want. Or you cheat. But if you cheat you can give yourself unlimited money and declare yourself the winner of the game, if you are that type of player.

       "  'review': 'At first glance it is a great game.  You get dropped into this mess of stuff with out any real good explanation.  There are helpful hints that take up 25% of the lower right corner of your screen.  But they do not really help you understand how the game functions.  Those helpful hints quickly become VERY annoying as they ruin the realism of the game and cannot be turned off.  I played this game on the PS4 about a year ago.  Coming back into it now, even with my previous experience, I find myself lost.  After a while though I got it all sorted out and was moving long nicely.  I start to REALLY enjoy the game.  But then I start hitting one bug after another.  Plains do fly right, plants once harvested can never be harvested again, strange strange display bugs.  They promised multiplayer but it does not work.  Spent hours just trying to see my friend.  Got it working once or twice but that was all.  After hours and hours of play I hit yet another of the endless bugs.  Suddenly I cannot edit the main part of my base.. The base only has about 15 items but it seems that is some sort of limit.  This is where I stopped.  I have had enough.  But the most frustrating bug of all is when you are in VR choosing the build menu.  Some careless  programmer switched the menus.  So when you see the menu and select an item in the tree it is on the right.  But after you enter the menu it is on the left... so.. you find yourself in the wrong menu EVERY TIME!  This is so frustrating.  How could that get past beta testing?  DO THEY EVEN TEST THIS GAME?  (:\\n\\nIt is very clear to me that  the programmers that made this were sitting in office chairs and not on a couch.  Try opening your ship when the leavers to do it are INSIDE YOUR COUCH under you, next to you.  And the controls the fly the ship are virtual and deep inside your crotch.  This causes you to have to bend your wrist in some pretty strange ways to get the ship to fly.\\n\\nAnyhow, after hours of play the game got very laggy.  Going into any area causes the game to hang up and give me lots of strange mind bending display errors.   If you use VR you know what that is like.  Between that and my base locking up I am more or less over this game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is not worth its money at all. I came into this game after hearing all the great reviews of the latest content patch and how everyone likes the game now. But its pretty clear that everyone has some rose-tinted goggles on.\\n\\nThe game is significantly better from release but it's still so damn disappointing. \\n\\nMULTIPLAYER\\n-   Not really multiplayer at all, the coop elements arent integrated enough. Quests cant be shared, progress cant be shared etc.\\n-   A lot of things are client side and just simply dont appear for your coop partner. Weather storm coming? Just for you.\\n-   The hub is pretty boring.\\n\\nCONTROLS\\n-    The controls are awful, the UI and UX are poorly designed and show no intuition\\n\\nSTORY\\n-    The story was pretty intriguing at first but falls behind quick due to the obscene bugs blocking you from actually progressing through it.\\n\\nPROGRESSION\\n-    The progression in this game is terrible, going from starting gear to end game gear is pretty much one step. Not to mention the fact that you can get all the credits you'll ever need by visiting some randoms base that gives away end game minerals.\\n-    Also you can use save editors to spawn anything you want in.\\n\\nBASE BUILDING\\n-    This was actually pretty good, lots of things to choose from but ultimately the experience was ruined by the UI.\\n\\nOverall for the price 5/10!\\n\\nId pay 20 bucks at most for this.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m not one of those who was bitter over the game release, because I saw that debacle coming and stayed out of it. I didn\\'t buy the game until the Atlas Rises update, and I really enjoyed playing it for a while. It was a chill game with plenty to do. My only real problem with it was the base building limitations. Pieces would disappear and there are rendering problems, that persist to this day.\\n\\nAfter building some decent bases, buying a bunch of ships and designing a nice freighter, I put it on a shelf for a while until the \"Atlas Next\" update came out. In this update, they decided to redesign all of the stuff that was working fine and I spent a full weekend rebuilding and repairing everything I had (well actually more, when you count having to redo the freighter from scratch), and by the end of that, I was burned out on the game again. I didn\\'t really get to play much, I mostly just got back to where I was before and put it on the shelf again.\\n\\nThen I hear about the \"Beyond\" update and I get excited because it seems like they added VR. I heard it\\'s buggy and even borderline unplayable, but I still want to check out my ships and builds. Before attempting VR, I log in and my base is, of course, missing pieces again, but worse, they added a new onerous power requirement to everything and it looks like it will take a lot longer than a weekend to get back to where I was again. I then logged out for the last time. Even if I wanted to update my bases with hundreds of cables, they wouldn\\'t be able to handle it, performance wise. It\\'s probably worse than any other building game out there, in that respect.\\n\\nIf I would have thought of it, I would have snapshoted this game, before this latest update, so that I could still play on occasion again. It was fun for a while and I guess I got my money\\'s worth. But all of the game breaking updates make me not want to invest anymore time in NMS. I play a lot of Alpha games, and they\\'re all typically more stable and better optimized than this 3+ year old game. And by adding a lot of micromanagement to a game that typically hasn\\'t had it, it just doesn\\'t feel the same anymore. I play enough grindy games, I don\\'t need another.\\n\\nI kind of regret the time I put into it now, and therefore I can\\'t recommend it. And no way, is it ever worth the full price.',\n",

I bought it after the Beyond VR update, people say the big updates have fixed the game so I can't imagine what it was like at launch.\\n\\nOverall the game is addictive fun, but lacking in almost every area. The game tries to do a lot but doesn't do anything well.\\n\\nThe multiplayer aspects are barely there, it's basically playing single player alongside a friend. There's no sort of cheat protection either. Fps performance is poor.\\n\\nControls and menus are bad, especially ship controls. Inventory management is difficult and inventories are too small. Dialogue is unskippable most of the time and fairly slow/boring. The open world aspects are good (transitions from planet to space etc.), but the joy of exploration drops off quickly and new areas become repetitive. Base building is fun but not useful. Survival is not challenging unless you play hardcore, which makes the game more grindy.\\n\\nGear progression in the game is paced badly. And once you have enough capital/inventory space to farm cash it invalidates a lot of other game mechanics.The quest chain is pretty interesting but apart from the story and grinding for gear there's no endgame.\\n\\nAfter ~20 hrs you've seen most of the game. Unless you're a completionist I don't think the game is worth $40 let alone $80. Buy Subnautica instead.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The last thing that could have saved this game would be awesome ship mechanics. They did not deliver. There are about 5 variations of ships which are hardly distinguishable besides by look. The game is vast and empty. Visiting new planets and systems is more of a chore than a progression. The whole game is more of a chore than a game. Lots of bugs. AI may as well be non existent. Dialogue is petrifying. Your quest changes whenever you pick something up that has a tutorial attached, This happens so often in the beginning of the game that you end up hours in and still not aware that you havent been doing the main quest. The main quest...... I can hardly remember it. If its a space game youre after I would recommend Avorion or Pulsar, both of which are light years ahead of this STEAMing mess.',\n",

VR is the normal hot mess of really good potential with lots of quirks and problems.  Some of the controls in VR finally feel like a game made for VR rather than a PC to VR port, but others result in a huge loss of fine motor control that just make it frustrating.  Some examples are trying to focus on objects you want to interact with (open boxes, pick up cubes, etc).  Trying to mark items in the visor in VR is also problemmatic since you kind of have to look at the item out of the corner of your eye for the mark option to even be available..',\n",

       "  'review': 'I decided to give this game a try after so many updates and found it horrible. Extremely shallow game with no content that tries to slow you down as much as possible to deceive you that it is long. I\\'ve asked for  a refund 3 times and was denied because by the time that I\\'ve realized how bad the game was the 2 hours had already passed. I recommend it to anyone who wants to play pretend, not to anyone who wants a game with real progression. For this there is Terraria, Astroneer, Subnautica and Satisfactory.\\n\\nHere are some of the negatives. You could write a book with so many design problems and bugs that the game has, but the review would be too long:\\n\\n- Excessive grinding involved in everything you do, including forcing you to talk to virtually ALL NPCs and hear the same idiotic phrase to learn ONE word of their language, otherwise you don\\'t understand anything they say;\\n\\n- Even when selecting menu options has griding. Each time you select something, you have to hold the button for + or - 1 second to confirm. Over time it becomes increasingly annoying;\\n\\n- If you think the ships and upgrades you pick up later will make the gameplay more varied, forget it. They only boosts the skills that your character and vehicles already know how to do. Congratulations on buying a expensive upgrade to sprint 10% longer!;\\n\\n- All this game does is to slow you down and make duration of it artificially much longer than it should, with quests \"go from point A and collect / build / kill x and come back\";\\n\\n-Spaceflight is also a totally limited and repetitive crap, with more asteroids than open space. Every time an enemy comes to interrupt the already boring flight from one planet to another. It has no interesting star body;\\n\\n- Inventory management (which is tiny by the way) has to grind up space stations to expand it, with chests that fit 5 f * cking item stacks that require power to function. By doing so, they force you to trash of loot to force you to collect it again later, going back to what I\\'ve said regarding to \"slow you down\".\\n\\nPositive:\\n\\n- Graphics. Wonderful. But still, I expected a real game, not a photo simulator.\\n\\nBuy at your own risk.',\n",

       "  'review': \"The Beyond update was intended to improve the game.  For long-time players it seems to have offered enough to revitalize their game.  They have, however, lived with so many of the game's issues that remain broken and their used to them and so they're happy with the fixes.  But for new players old problems are not welcome and patches and fixes have created yet more problems.  This, coupled with some odd design choices, make the game problematic as a whole, especially for $60.\\n\\nOnce you acquire a freighter, it's possible to fall through the superstructure and die in space, or get trapped outside the playable space meaning you have to reload or die.\\n\\nThere are lots of technologies available but tutorials/information on them are minimal.  The game does have, sort of, a guided quest system that helps, somewhat.\\n\\nYou can't truly upgrade your existing ship, i.e., add tech slots and those that exist are not positioned to make what improvements you can make playable.  \\n\\nThe only way to 'upgrade' your ship is to buy a new one or find a broken one.  The problem here is, if you have been able to add tech upgrades to your ship, many of these are not transferable, which means you lose your investment and need to purchase things all over again.\\n\\nIt's a space game with trading stations all over.  Yet, you can't buy a ship there.  You can buy ship improvements but there's no dry dock so you can't reconfigure the ship you have.\\n\\nInformation/tutorials on game play are a frost.  You can seek some help on YouTube, but the problem here is few of these are helpful, mostly just older players showing off--see me and how good I am, not tutorials.  Further most of those available are so far out of date as to be counter productive.\\n\\nDon't know what it is about some game developers having it in for saving games.  The process here is truly annoying and cumbersome, especially give the glitch noted earlier about falling through the infrastructure and getting trapped.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Too buggy. Too inconsistent. Way too many things that you'd expect the game to easily have, like:\\n- Colorblind mode. The game expects you to differentiate between differently tiered star systems by colors alone. A nice big middle finger to the colorblind. Thanks Hello Games!\\n- A competent building system. What's that? You just placed removed a floor and can't add it back again? Either reload your save from 20 minutes ago, or enjoy the next 20 minutes replacing every single thing, and possibly losing materials because of their ridiculously buggy inventory system. Never mind the countless of times where you can't put something where you want it, despite there being no good reason whatsoever as to why you can't.\\n- Not having your ship spawn inside existing things. You just made your base next to something pre-existing, to continue a nice symbiotic relationship. But lo and behold, the game decides to just plant your ship inside their building when you get back to your base.\\n- An amazing storyline where you learn to use portals to go anywhere in the universe. ...only to be locked into that system, making portals entirely useless. I understand the devs don't want people rushing towards the end, but why not? Let people play how they want to play.\\n- An innovative way to learn 3 different languages. By taking 30 seconds every time you want to learn a new word because you have to click 3 buttons and go through 5 different slow text boxes to get there, and there being no good other way to learn these languages. There's like 10K words for each language.\\n- A fun way to edit terrain. You can simply paint spheres onto terrain or dig spheres into terrain, middle finger to anyone who likes to make tidy bases, amirite?\\n- GUI to be intuitive and easy to use. Because nobody likes going through 5 different menus and long lists to earn a specific currency in the game, while in a previous version you had a singular button that would do all of that for you. Nobody likes being used to one inventory system, and then have some type of outdated buggy inventory system that refuses to let you take out anything.\\n- Expandable inventory systems. Sure, you can upgrade your own inventory over time, and I'm sure if it's completely upgraded, it'll be super useful. But I do not fathom why you wouldn't be able to create large inventory systems in the bases that you can create. Why not drop off large amounts of valuables and store them deep underground? Why force the player to be continuously in the stress of what they have to throw away next to get that one item they now need as well?\\n- Some remote type of way to get the player what they want without being 3000% dependable on RNG. It's absolutely mental how the only way to become more versatile and stronger in this game is entirely up to RNG. There's no technical progression, there's just grinding and random luck to get what you want. It's Beyond frustrating.\\n\\nI was one of the idiots who pre-purchased this because everything looked amazing, but ended up refunding it. Only to buy it years later on a discount when people can't shut up about how much it has improved.\\n\\nIt hasn't. It's still awful. It has a ton of new content, if you can drag your sore butt through all of the bugs and grinding this game forces you to do. What a complete waste of what could otherwise be an absolutely amazing game.\\n\\nDo not recommend, just because of the sheer frustration, anger, sorrow and hate this game has caused me.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I bought No Man\\'s Sky right before the BEYOND update when it was 50 percent off. I feel that was a fair price for what I got. Obviously I\\'ve sunk some time into the game, so while I cannot really say the game is bad, I also cannot say I\\'d recommend it to anyone at full price. And I\\'m not sure I\\'d recommend it even then until there are more updates.\\n\\nThe problem with NMS -- the thing that ultimately made me say, \"Eh, time to try something else\" -- is that the \"world\" feels so small and unvaried. \\n\\nYou are ostensibly an explorer in an endless galaxy, able to visit infinite worlds, and yet every world you visit feels like a differently-colored version of the same world, inhabited by the same sentient alien races, with the same set-pieces and the same rewards. After you\\'ve been to a dozen or so star systems, all sense of wonder is gone because every star system has one of three versions of the same space station, is controlled by one of the same three races, and consists of somewhere between one and a dozen worlds that look essentially like every other world you\\'ve previously visited.\\n\\nPut another way: NMS is premised on exploration but for all intents and purposes you\\'re done with the exploration about 20 - 30 hours into the game because by that point you\\'ve met every NPC alien race, seen every architectural set piece, harvested the same resources on the same five or six types of planets, seen the same two or three types of freighter ships, etc. Some examples of what I\\'m talking about:\\n\\n* There are a couple varieties of freighter ships, including some admittedly beautiful rare ones. But the interior of every freighter is exactly the same, so it kind of doesn\\'t matter. Same thing with space stations: every star system has one, but every station is, on the inside, exactly the same.\\n\\n* There are buildings and ruins scattered on every planet, but all the buildings, etc., use the same handful of models, but with different colors. So irrespective of how strange the world itself looks (and very, very few of them look genuinely strange or \"alien\"), the \"places\" you visit on each planet are the same.\\n\\n* There are three sentient races and they apparently populate every star system throughout the galaxy. You\\'ll never meet a previously undiscovered NPC race, or make contact with an obscure alien empire -- you\\'re only ever going to meet one of three alien types. \\n\\nNMS is, to me, a poor man\\'s Subnautica. The contrast between the two games really highlights how you can achieve a better sense of wonder and fear and discovery with a carefully-curated setting where there\\'s real, artistic variety between biomes and among creatures -- where exploration allows you to explore further, deeper, into more dangerous places that feel different than any place you\\'ve ever been before -- than in a game that simply takes place in an \"infinite\" galaxy where everything is basically a dozen shades of the same thing.\\n\\nNMS has the bones of a truly ground-breaking and amazing experience. But it\\'s not worth $60 USD. Perhaps in an update or two, with more variety or a better story (don\\'t even get me started on how sloppy and predictable that was), it will be that game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Decided to give this game a try since I had heard it had VASTLY improved.\\n\\nApparently, this universe hates me, since after landing on my second planet, with all equipment still at level 0 and not even finished with the tutorial, it landed me in a group of hostile lifeforms that tried to eat me, and sentinels that killed me when I tried to defend myself. After dying, I was stuck. Hungry aliens still surround me, angry sentinels still preventing me from recharging my gear, and the planet itself trying to kill me so I can't run away to mine somewhere else. Yeah, not going to give this a recommendation, since I don't feel like dealing with this any more. It might be fun for other people, I might even be able to enjoy it myself if I got further, but I'm not going to put up with the annoying parts to get to any potential good parts.\\n\\nFinal Verdict: Start wasn't fun enough to get me to keep playing until it 'got better.' Refunded, not worth my money or the headache.\",\n",

I have sunk quite a few hours into this game but now the new update came out I am stuck on a mission. It is asking me to build the Artemis translator,.. however it is not available in my crafting menu. After searching online I can see there are a few others with the same problem. So basically all that gameplay down the drain because I can no longer progress through the storyline due to such a simple bug. Makes me really sad. I hope they can fix these issues soon.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Did a full playthough of NMS and sadly the negative views were right on every point, every planet is nearly identical to the last, the 'unique' parts of a planet could be counted on a single hand. On a full playthrough I counted thirteen 'Lilly-crabs' on different planets and seven 'Shroom-rats' How is this possible. But it gets better, each and every toxic planet is littered with mushroom trees that lack any unique features other then the games attempt to give them names. God forbid you read the writing of this game, it'll leave a seventh graders writing project look like a master piece, honestly the NPC coding may have been done by a seventh grader, they're all copys of each other, I swear where they sit may even be pre-set. Each race has maybe three-six lines worth of speech  rendering any translation or grinding pointless, once you've heard one Vy call you weak you've heard them all. I won't even bother talking about the constant bugs, poorly designed systems or the lack of combats relevance, the games a steaming pile and may as well just be wiped, it feels like the early early demo, no combat, NPCs are pointless, planets are barren, everything looks the same.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'You have to admire Hello Games and Sean Murray for not cutting and running after the disastrous (though thoroughly deserved) negative reception No Mans Sky received on its original release. Instead, like tenacious bulldogs, they stuck with their game, and several major updates later, here we are with \"Beyond\"....the biggest update yet. Good for them!\\n\\nSadly the main problem with NMS remains....the game is, at its heart, a boring and tedious grind of resource gathering. A grind, it should be noted, that is simply performed so that the player can get a little better at grinding.\\n\\nHad HG spent their time and resources making the core game play loop more fun and interesting, they\\'d surely have a stunning game to offer. As it is, despite all these new features they have added, the game remains merely a superior tech demo, still gagging for a game to be added.\\n\\nThe game\\'s strongest suit is \"Exploration\"....see the entire galaxy for yourself, one planet at a time. The problem is there is little here WORTH exploring in the first place. The galaxy may be massive, but it is also very, very dull. That leaves us with lack-luster space flight, lack-luster combat, lack-luster multiplayer interaction and lack-luster base-building. Not much to go on for a recommendation is it?',\n",

       "  'review': 'I wanted to try this game since I kept hearing it was THE game that actually turned it around, that they had taken their product that was one of the most infamous flops in video game history and made it into a great game with a dedicated following.  Well I tried it, I gave it my all and powered through the pain to give it a fair chance, and I just don\\'t get it.  And I don\\'t mean I don\\'t get it as in the zero story zero direction and no compelling aspects of multiplayer leave the gameplay so incomprehensibly unsatisfying that I can\\'t imagine playing it... I mean I don\\'t get it as in this is one of the buggiest games I have ever played-- and I played PUBG on release.  I found myself running into bugs, that required a work around to continue playing, in almost every aspect of the game.  Every time the work around was at minimum closing the entire game.  These bugs aren\\'t uncommon or only in niche circumstances, in fact most of them come up through natural gameplay and cause you to take drastic actions before you can continue playing.  What\\'s even worse is when I search all these bugs they\\'re all present in forum posts 2-3 years ago, and yet they still plague the game.  Additionally, nothing in this game is told do you.  It feels like one of those games where all the information we have had to be datamined and is only playable with a wiki being 60% of the gameplay.  Searching how almost any mechanic works gets you articles titled \"X things No Man\\'s Sky didn\\'t tell you.\"\\nTL:DR\\n-   Gameplay loop is strictly grinding for the sake of grinding with no payoff\\n-   The mostly consistently buggy game I\\'ve ever played\\n-   Everything is cryptic in an uninteresting and unrewarding way\\n-   1/10  it\\'s not impossible to enjoy the game if you like the grind but the game holds no punches trying to stop you',\n",

No idea because I am so concerned about not dying to sunstroke that I feel I don\\'t have enough time to read all the information popping up on the screen. I can either sit in the heat and read WTF is happening or just run around and try and find a shady spot to not die. \\n\\nI start a new game in the easiest difficulty and now I am dying from radiation. This game has a terrible tutorial system. I have no idea what my buttons/controls are and already dying from something.\\n\\nTake a page from Subnautica\\'s book and learn how to slowly introduce a new idea/mechanic. In that game I had no idea on what to do, however with very basic idea and a system that doesn\\'t kill you as you read/understand the basic principles of the games, it makes sense. I\\'m underwater, swim to the surface to get air. Easy.\\n\\nBut with No Man Sky I am immediately filled with death because I have no idea what I need to do to not burn to death. \\n\\nIf anything don\\'t just put people randomly in space with nothing. Introduce the idea of \"whatever you are trying to get them to learn\" in doses. \\n\\nEX: Player states in a airlock/base that is *VERY SLOWLY* getting hotter. An announcer states that the player must user X item to cool it down. X item can be found in the supply room. Uh oh, supply room only enough to support the base and your suit for 24 hours. You now need to find X item out on the new planet you discovered and have established a base on. \\n\\nThe idea of putting someone in a \"dangerous situation\" and teaching them about to use all the buttons and controls makes a huge difference. The best example I can give is Subnautica. \\n\\n\"OMG we crash landed on an alien planet, and you need to do XYZ\". \\n\\nI didn\\'t instantly get attacked by the environment. I did need to worry about food and water. But I wasn\\'t instantly dying from the start.\\n\\nI heard so many good things and bad things about No Man Sky, and honestly if you want to play an exploration game with survival quality. Pick up any of the following:\\n\\nSubnautica\\nMinecraft\\nDon\\'t Starve\\n\\nThey mostly have no tutorial but the basic idea of what I need to do to not instantly die is present. I know I need to find food, water and shelter. With No Man Sky I just feel lost and like I am not having fun. All of the other games listed I almost immediately enjoyed an wanted to play more. No Man Sky? I wish I never wasted the 30 minutes I played it.',\n",

But if you were to ask me I would say that's a load of bollocks. From playing this for less than 2 hours I can say, with full confidence.... don't buy this bloody game. It takes on a repetitive feel and many things about the game feel lifeless and empty, I bet a dead person would be more alive that this shit. The game was fun for possibly half an hour or so but after the first planet I realised that you have to do the same thing every time but with slightly different scenery. Revolutionary.\\n\\nTo be fair, the game looks beautiful. It's colourful and sometimes satisfying to explore a little. But then you realise your life support is failing and you're about to die.\\n\\nI tried to give this game a chance as I have watched it grow slowly while keeping up with update news.

The minimum requirements listed are a fat lie and you are pissing your cash into the wind with anything less than a 1080.\\n\\nOn my home PC (the only one I can actually just chill and game on), I am running a GTX 660, 16 GB ram, core i5 2400 3.10Ghz.\\n\\nI don't get more than 17fps on lowest settings and NONE of the tweaks on the internet can fix that.\\n\\n\\nAs my girlfriend got this for me as a gift its a real fucking sore point that they state clearly that it SHOULD run on an even older setup. Well yeah, if you think RUN means 10FPS with constant splutter is acceptable. Unfortunately my testing took longer than Steams refund policy, I got doubly fucked by this. I really wanted it to work, but nope.\\n\\nSo here is a warning to those thinking about checking it out. If you don't have a NEW beast of a gaming rig, please please look elsewhere. \\n\\nAt least I got Dark Souls 3 instead and have (and definitely will) clocked more hours and counting there than most of my other titles together. All settings maxed, it looks amazing and not an ounce of splutter, lag or any other performance bullshit.\\n\\nMaybe in a few years when I can fully upgrade, I'll give this another go but for now, its just a filthy stain on my Steam account.\\n\\n\",\n",

But even after this so called Beyond update, everything is tedious. Gathering resources takes hours. Some planets wont have the resources you're looking for. Sometimes, even if a planet says it has copper, you can walk around for hours and not find a single deposit.\\n\\nThe quest line is tedious. You're constantly travelling between planets. Not only do you spend an obscene amount of time just waiting for your spaceship to arrive in the right planet, you only spend a second or two talking to an npc or building a machine. I could not get past the boredom of watching my spaceship travel between planets and galaxies.\\n\\nAfter the novelty wears off, the game is not as exciting as I hoped it to be. But underneath the tedious quests and resource gathering, I believe there is a good game. But as it is now, it is still not worth its 60 dollar price tag.\",\n",

Anyway, things were fine until the NMS Beyond update DLC, and now the game is unplayable.  I have an AMD Radeon R7 and R9.  I have uninstalled it and am wiping my hands of it.  The reason is simple: It is unplayable and it is impossible to show you why.  I took screenshots and they look fine, as they should, but the game itself becomes a Tye-Dye mess upon launch.  To that end, for the moment, I am done.  I was enjoying the open exploration and various gameplay, but this is too much to deal with, as I have other titles that don't frustrate me and run just fine.  The creators have released several updates since Beyond dropped, but none have mattered to my problem.  So, I'm out for now on this one. I can't recommend this title as a result.\",\n",

Do not listen to anyone that says otherwise.\\nLeaving a space station and attempting to warp to a planet somehow got me stuck inside of the station, which caused me to take damage with no way to escape, so I died and lost everything in my ship and person. Then, when I respawned on some planet I've never been to, I started high up and fell to my death, again. Somehow respawning must have overwritten my save, so there was no way to get all the items I had and needed back, as my last save in the manual slot was over ten hours of of playtime less as I was warping around planets towards the galactic core. I don't see how they could even consider adding a permadeath mode in this game while it is in this state. This is a massive setback and I doubt I will ever be able to play this game again.\\nTo add to this, the game has awful performance, and extremely obvious pop in, which can sometimes cause you to crash into things. Many things still have awful extremely low quality textures even though I stand right in front of them.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'That Hello Games is still trying to provide the game they lied about releasing 3 years ago is commendable, unfortunately it still is deeply flawed. Even after the latest update the game remains an amalgamation of botched, half-assed, broken.\\n\\nYes, the game has its moments: Discovering new planets, especially some of the pre-made anomalous ones, can be enjoyable and while the gameplay is shallow, it is so in a pleasant way. However:\\n\\nThe UI is a Frankenstein\\'s monster of botched console port and poor design decisions. During development and in the 3 years since release, no apparent effort has been made to adapt the UI to PC. Every button, every menu and every screen handles akwardly and screams \"made for console\". The current patch introduced the biggest advancement in this area since 3 years ago: The duration for which you have to hold your mouse button to make a click has been reduced from ~2s to almost instant in various menus.\\nOnce you have finally reached your desired menu, the functions are lacking and information is poorly visualized whereever not absent. Even the most basic features like the solar system and galaxy maps are barely functional and would be an embarrasment even for an Indy-game in Alpha made by 2 people.\\n\\nEven after more than a dozen patches in roughly a week, the game remains buggy and has been so for years. While the effort to provide patches quickly is commendable, the fact that the new update was released in such a state gives you an idea of value HG places on quality-assurance and -control, and a sinister forshadowing of the amount of bugs amd issues you will encounter while playing.\\nContinuing the reoccuring theme of \"botched, half-assed and broken\", even content that is years old still is troubled by basic and glaring issues. To give an example: If you google the problem that terrain is regenerating back into bases and buildings you built, you will find threads from over a year ago. HG said that they were looking into it, the issue remains unsolved to this day.\\n\\nIn general many features feel unfinished and rushed, even reworks used to promote the \"new big update\" are made half-assed: While the player inventory was increased to be able to hold dozens of large stacks of items, HG did not update a single one of the various other inventories(ships, freighters, storage containers, ...), leaving them grotesquely out of line. Botched, half-assed, broken.\\n\\nThe asking price of 55€ is obscene, and even the current discount of -50% does not feel like a great deal for what you get.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I returned to No Man's Sky Beyond after the initial No Man's Sky PS4 release in 2016. I left at some point because it reached a plateau where things felt stagnant and became more of the same grinding. Now in 2019, with a Valve Index and powerful PC, and, of course, all of the exciting developer updates in Beyond, I was super excited for the VR space adventure. Alas, the bubble has burst after my last few game experiences. Crashing after exploring a good hour on a planet (losing all progress), aliens buried in the floor when talking to them, and ultimately no longer loading in (crashing after a 10 minute load time wait, when nothing has changed since my last game). All these took me out of the immersive VR experience that could have been. It feels like this game has gotten too top heavy for its good. I appreciate the patch after patch release, but it ultimately made my game experience so unstable, I've completely aborted the No Man's Sky mission once again. It's too bad, because it has so much potential to be the best VR game experience. But when you lose precious time to game breaking technical issues, it's just not worth your investment. Try, if you must. But it won't do. I really wanted to like this game, but it's a broken black hole. Not recommended.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Ok here is my honest review of NSM. Iv’e been playing for around a week and I can say NMS is a fun enjoyable game in concept. \\nThere is plenty to do, enough to keep you going & without being tedious or too time-consuming. Following the mission's path is fun when it works and the game won't put huge roadblocks in your way to progression, at least early on. \\nTo start with it was very enjoyable and I was looking forward to progressing into all that NMS has to offer.\\nHowever, there is one big fat massive elephant in the room & that's the fact that almost every system in the game is either poorly designed or even worse is riddled with game-breaking bugs.\\nNMS, a game that’s been in full release since 2016! It is so broken that actual Early access/Pre-release games put it to shame. \\nJust a few examples of game-breaking bugs I have encountered that are so fundamental to the core of the game. 1. Logging off in the Anomaly (the multiplayer hub) can spawn you outside of the Invisible barrier of the playable space when you reload the game, with no way to escape. I had to use a 3rd party save file editor to change the position of my character to save my entire save game. 2. Bounty Encounters do not reward the currency for completing them. 3. The inventory expansion vendor does not charge you giving you free upgrades. 4. Some building blocks don't work i.e the Medical unit pivotal in healing your character without endlessly hunting crates on planets 5. Electrical hookup points just stop showing after aiming a wire at them causing you to reload the game every time you want to make an electrical connection. 6. Many “treasures” appear under the mesh of the planet below the excavatable material. 7. Items get stuck in storage telling you that your inventory is full even though it's empty. 8. Some blueprint pictures don't match their items/descriptions making it very frustrating to find what you thought you purchased. 9. Putting quick menu functions on the “Hotbar”(1-9) will all default to summon ship after a jump or teleportation. Ok, more than a few but I could sit here typing all day with issues I've had. I've been taking screenshots and OBS recordings, submitting bugs more than you would In any Early access game.\\nMoving on to poor game design first on the list is it's clear that NMS was developed for console and PC was an afterthought or a non-thought and clearly goes Consol>VR>>>>>>>>PC Basic functions like Keybinding are tedious as binding requires you to do though many “Quick Menus” (Which is broken anyway) and you cannot bind anything to the scroll wheel. Which would be useful for changing multitool functions but instead you have to mash G. You cant bind them individually to number keys either and ofc you cant use a hotas with NMS. \\nThe game gives you 4-5 different building sets that don't play well together mixing and matching is a mistake you will regret when things won't place at all or line up Furthermore Tech items cant be placed on some building types and others just won't place at all. Want a Large refiner on basic building sure go ahead. Try to place a medium nope you need to put it in the Large building prefab… Want to place storage inside. Good luck you have to place it outside on the terrain unless you Cheat it by placing a foundation strut on a Normal foundation then delete it after leaving the storage floating less have unsightly poles sticking down under your base. All this meanwhile your building from layers upon layers of clunky cumbersome scroll menus. Overall navigating the menus and systems of NMS is confusing and unintuitive, having to question basic functions on the game's discord regularly.  Then discovering that long-time players didn't even know you could do what you're asking like binding quick menu items to 1-9. So that changing from 1st -3rd person can be 1 button press and not a 4 “quick menu”  navigation task. \\nSo would I recommend NMS the answer is no! The concept is good. The execution is terrible. The coders must suffer from hand Tourette's with the number of bugs and broken features and the QA team must be huffing glue to let so many things slide by. \\nThe only good thing about NMS is its great discord community  \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"No Man's Sky is a brilliant concept of a game. It has so much potential for long addicting sessions of play. Yeah I'm only 30 hours in... but that's part of my point. I played for 3 ten hour sessions easily with how addicting the game felt. But the issues I ran into have really put a brick wall in my path.\\n\\nThere are major game breaking issues which you may run into if you decide to buy the game.\\n\\nThese issues will cause you to lose hours and hours of progress, which will surely demoralize your will to play.\\n\\nIt's not a great feeling to just suddenly clip through the floor because of a cutscene, and be insta-killed. And at that moment you're left to gather your 'grave' to retrieve your entire inventory... but your grave is in an out of bounds location.\\n\\nNot to mention other small bugs that litter the game.\\n\\nI'm not one to play 'hardcore' type game modes. But the game forces you into a pseudo-hardcore russian roulette state. You may not get hit with these bugs... but they are out there, and can happen to anyone.\\n\\nI hate leaving a poor review... the idea of this game is so good. However, the devs need to focus on polishing the concept, rather than continuing to add on more and more small mechanical and gameplay content.\\n\\nHG, fix the issues before you decide to develop more content, PLEASE.\\n\\nI've touched a tiny sliver of the game, and no longer want to play. This is not a good sell.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I had given NMS a thumbs up because it is a good game with some great parts but the longer I have played the more the glitches have crept in.\\nWhile I applaud Hello Games for bringing NMS a long way from its beginning I do believe the issue is that they have tried so hard to add content, which is what the players demand, that they have overlooked a number of minor problems that are indicative of bigger issues.\\nFor example, when you are in a some of the menus and you look in the lower right hand corner you see the command to press escape to leave the menu, so you press escape and nothing happens, so you right click because that works on other menus and you leave the screen.\\nNow some may say \"What the fuck dude, just press the fucking right mouse key and play this big beautiful game.\"\\nBut this shows an inconsistency in how you use menus that is just sloppy and should be an easy fix.\\nIn video games consistency is very important, not because players are to stupid to figure stuff out but when you have menu interaction behaving differently from one screen to the next, escape working on some screens right click on others, it slowly erodes confidence.\\nWhile this is one small example it is one of many small QOL issues that add up.\\nBut this is not why I changed my review, it was just a foundation brick.\\nThe final problem was when looking for large copper deposit to mine I trekked over to one I had marked with my scanner only to find nothing there. I thought maybe it had spawned under ground so I gouged out a bloody big hole looking for the thing to no avail. I dug until all the little boxes were gone from pressing c but nothing but silica. The indicator was still there but then again, and this gets on my nerves, even when you deplete a deposit the indicator is still there so when you get turned around on a barren world you trek back to a hole in the ground that, according to the scanner should be full of something.\\nAgain small issue that adds up.\\nThen the indicator of what element made up trees and rocks stopped working and I wrote this review.\\nStop adding content. We believe you when you say you aren\\'t Satan in human form, you can make a good game Hello Games.\\nFix your games core mechanics, we will wait, you wowed us, people won\\'t stop playing if you don\\'t keep coming out with new stuff but they will when they are buried by glitches and bugs.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit a few months after this original review:  I cannot play the game as it is, I gave it a few months to get fixed and fired it up today on a whim.  The game is working even worse than it did before, so badly that I played for less than 5 minutes before I had to quit. I want to play the game. It\\'s fun when it doesn\\'t give me a headache because of how poorly it works. I\\'ll try again in a year.\\n\\nThis is a mix of a good and bad review. I would say yes I recommend the game, but not if you are having the issues I am having. The Beyond update brought a lot a good changes to the game, however my experience has been less than ideal. Before the update I would get a small stutter every now and then and while it was annoying, it was a very minor annoyance. Now I\\'m lucky to have a stable 20 FPS, and it usually just stutters enough to be extremely annoying but not enough to make me delete the game. I keep playing a bit every day to see if the problem has been fixed but nothing has changed.\\n\\nThere is also an issue with using an Xbox One controller, it will not let me use \"X\" to tag items or places, and sometimes it disconnects from the game completely. I would say the disconnect might be interference but it only disconnects on NMS. I\\'ve played 2 or 3 other games with absolutely zero issues.\\n\\nBasically, I love the game and it\\'s very fun. I want to play much more than I\\'m able. I might just have to put it on the back burner for a month or 3 until some performance issues get fixed.',\n",

       "  'review': \"No Man's Sky is by far the buggiest game I have ever played, so far in my playthrough, I have fallen through the map literally countless times. My game has crashed probably 20+ times and there is always a visual bug present. These bugs are completely unacceptable for a $60 3-year-old triple A-game. Not only are there bugs but the game is so poorly optimized that running the game on any decent settings can cause even beefy systems to take huge fps drops. The game certainly has fun aspects to it, the economic system is pretty enjoyable, the missions are for the most part good, and the upgrade system is nice. The only part of the whole experience that is done exceptionally well is the sheer scale of things. The amount of room you have to do what you want is amazing. Planets feel huge and considering solar systems can have 6+ planets per system that means you have just insane amounts of room. The issue lies in what is done with this room, while yes there is nearly infinite space to build on, there just simply isn't a lot to build. The base building mechanics are very simple and for a lot of people won't even change how they play the game. Having a base is not remotely essential, you gain nothing but shelter and access to missions by building a base. The best or at least the most profitable aspect of base building is farms you can make with mineral extractors that bring in millions of dollars entirely passively. These are decently easy to make and only require some buried tech and a few million dollars to buy materials (if you can't get them on your own.) This completely changes the balance of the game, suddenly that $40 million ship is no longer an insane investment that will bankrupt you but it's just a few hours of waiting. Trying to get a lot of money without a farm is pretty hard but arguably more enjoyable. Doing this will consist of you looking for ancient bones or salvageable tech. This means you have to find planets that have either one of these and then actually explore said planet. This makes money feel genuinely valuable and like a reward rather than something you just have. Back on the topic of base building, say you wanted to make a base and live in it what would that take? Well for starters your gonna need constant power, this would be fine if the power system was even remotely balanced. At first, you will probably make a bio-fuel generator, this will power a base for a very short time at the cost of a whole lot of carbon or oxygen, this is absolutely insane considering that solar panels are just a bit more expensive and will power your base for free. After you have your base powered with a few batteries and solar panels you will likely upgrade that to an electromagnetic generator. This is by far the easiest and most abundant source of power in the entire game. A single electromagnetic generator will power huge bases for just the cost of building it (which is incredibly low.) This is not balanced at all, you can literally power everything you can possibly want for super cheap and entirely passively. Even ignoring the power imbalance the actual wiring mechanics are horrid. This is a game where you talk to otherworldly lifeforms, can warp hyperspace, and literally teleport, and yet for some reason, there is no wireless power. What in the hell was Hello Games thinking? the wiring system is the least intuitive thing out of the entire game. Wires are always visible and will go through walls, they are huge as hell and make weird jagged angles, you can't connect wires from one base to another, etc. Trying to power something like a door is so confusing, for starters when a door is powered it is closed, why the hell is is that? There are no buttons automatically on a door so you have to go out and research them, after you have researched a button you place it on the door, power the door, and nothing happens. Buttons don't actually work on doors because for some reason power flows through the button into the door and is never shut off. Now you have to go back and research a lever or power inverter and try that. Finally, you get back, set everything up and now you can enter your base. At this point you realize that all you have build is a single door. \\n\\n\\n     The combat in this game is split into 2 parts, ground based player combat, and space combat. The player combat consists of fighting small drones called sentinels which come in waves that lead up to a huge walker robot that has 5 protective plates before you can hurt its actual health. This combat is not at all entertaining and feels more like a chore than it does a game mechanic. Not only is it boring but it doesn't reward you in the slightest. Often time fighting sentinels will be forced upon you since they will attack you if you mine anything near them, shoot any animals near them, or sometimes just are near them. If the player had any way of taking them out rapidly this wouldn't be as bad, however, all the weapon options are absolutely terrible. None of the weapons do any decent damage and all frequently require charging or reloading, this means most of your fighting will be done with the mining laser which is the most consistent weapon in the game but it is also slow and boring to use. On the topic of space fights the verdict is almost the same. Once more fights are forced upon you by hostile sub-space scans. These scans will appear at random while you are in space and can be avoided if you give the hostiles a typically large amount of money. Refusing to give them money will cause 1-5 hostile ships to warp in front of you, prevent you from warping and force you to slowly turn you ship to chip away their incredibly tiny, far away ship. There should be either no space combat or an entirely reworked system of space combat. All of these problems are just amplified in the new VR addition which is somehow more buggy than the base game. Give this game another 3 years in the oven and maybe it will be worth the full price.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Reviewers that I trust have been saying that this game has become a lot better since its original release, even good, so I thought it would be a good idea to try it out.\\n\\nWhen starting I'm already not very impressed with the UI. Buttons and other widgets move around trying to follow the cursor in a distracting manner. I have to long-click most things in order to activate them. I switched from keyboard/mouse to an XBox Elite controller which makes the interface quirks a bit more tolerable in my opinion.\\n\\nI spawn on a planet that has some sort of hazard, and I need sodium to prevent my spacesuit from melting. Off I go to harvest some sodium from glowing yellow plants. I have to manually recharge the spacesuit with the sodium I gathered, which is unnecessarily awkward to do, then head to my spaceship, which won't take off because it is damaged. I must follow instructions on screen in order to get materials and craft what I need to repair it. The whole thing is quite confusing but gets me flying.\\n\\nI take off and try to hover, but the ship will not stay put. It will always inch forward. It's not that it needs lift from moving forward as it's going too slowly for that. It just refuses to lower itself to the level of a helicopter. In most simulators the yoke works as in a real airplane, which means that if I pull on it it the nose of the spaceship will rise, but here it does the opposite. Also the yoke's lateral movement usually controls roll, but here it is yaw. I guess I'll just get used to face planting every time I take off, or eventually get around to remapping the controller.\\n\\nFlying out of the planet's atmosphere feels great, although space looks excessively bright, has way too many densely-packed asteroids that appear from nowhere, and planets are too close together. It's like flying through an impressionist painter's idea of space.\\n\\nI spend a few hours playing and I still need to get over my instinct to pull the yoke to go up, but that's not my biggest source of frustration. For a game that seems to be focused on collecting materials and crafting things out of them, managing inventories is confusing. Different categories of things such as raw materials, crafted stuff, deployable structures and upgrades all go in the same type of generic slot. They are not even color-coded in a way that makes any sense. The very limited slot count in the exosuit inventory is downright irritating.\\n\\nOn the subject of being irritated, I find myself staring at the laser beam that comes out of my multi-tool a lot longer than I would like to, not because I'm having a blood-pumping fight against some powerful antagonist. I fire the laser at a tree for a few seconds, the tree quivers and then it is gone. I fire the laser at a rock, the rock quivers and it is gone. I question my life's choices as I fire the mining laser at every inanimate object I find in order to get a trickle of materials that I can use to craft one annoying trinket after another that I need in order to accomplish the most basic of tasks.\\n\\nI set out on a boring quest to get fifty units of oxygen, ten units of sodium, a hundred units of copper, and three hundred units of iron to craft a metal pipe to hit myself repeatedly over the head in order to get enough brain damage so that I can continue playing.\\n\\nMost of the time I am not flying around enjoying the breathtaking scenery, anticipating the next adventure, trying to figure out some mystery or soaking in the story. Instead I am frantically running around trying to get more sodium, oxygen or copper in order to fix a valve in my suit through which my soul is being drained, Then I'll be able to look for something fun to do, maybe on the next planet, maybe on the next station. Before that happens I discover that I need to get more iron to craft another metal pipe because the first one broke after a hundred blows.\\n\\nMaybe this is not the right game for me. Maybe I don't care about collecting all the sodium, oxygen or copper that I can scavenge. Maybe I don't care about different but oddly similar alien dinosaurs or poisonous exploding plants. I don't care about wisdom stones that teach me a single word of some alien language. It's all such a boring chore that I'm going to take my helmet off the next time a radioactive super-heated storm hits so that I can put an end to my misery in the most painful way possible. At least I will get to feel something.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'If you\\'re getting this for space exploration your enjoyment meter is going to run out fairly quick. You will still get your money\\'s worth but you\\'re going to hit the \"seen it all\" wall quickly. If you\\'re buying this with the idea of base building, well then my friend, this is your game. As of the Beyond update the base building IS the end game. Me personally? I can\\'t stand base building. If I must do It, I construct the most basic building with only the essentials then I go right back to exploring. \\n\\nI used to love finding abandoned star ships and other poi with the signal booster. Well, that\\'s not working properly any more. It has become hit and miss and compounds the grind further. But hey, I should probably just go back to my base and grind it out for the power hook ups. Or maybe tame some useless creatures that serve zero purpose in the game. Man. They have definitely steered the game play more towards base building than anything else.\\n\\nSince the beyond update my frame rate has increased, but that comes at the price of draw distance. You see before Beyond, I had an acceptable frame rate and I almost never noticed items and textures popping into frame. Now? It happens directly in front of you. No matter what graphical settings I adjust, it still happens. Maxed or Low, doesn\\'t make a difference. Maybe it\\'s my setup you say? Well maybe? I have proper settings in Windows and Nvidia control panel and I\\'m using a well cooled 2080 ti. So as far as I can tell it is a problem and it\\'s not coming from my end.\\n\\nI wish there was a neutral value for reviews as I would assign this game one.\\nOnly get this game if it\\'s on sale at a good discount.',\n",

However there are only about 5 types of planet: desert, frozen, fungal, radioactive, watery. Once you have seen one you have seen them all. Although the fauna and flora are procedurally generated, they all look pretty much the same, the planets all have the same half dozen resources etc.\\nThe resource mechanic is poorly through out. It is largely grinding out the same few resources to use to grind away at trading, to get a better ship to allow you to grind away slightly faster. The whole thing feels like one of those terrible Idle-Clicker mobile games.\\nThe real killer though is the interface. It is poorly thought out and clearly designed for a console and badly retrofitted for PC. The interface system is counter intuitive and clumsy. You are also forced to sit through the same cut scene hundreds of times every time you interact with anything.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Played initially on PS4, bought this on PC exclusively to try out VR.\\n\\nI'm leaving this as feedback, it's not meant to be critical, and i'd like to point out that this review is especifically for the VR portion of the gameplay. The game itself is a nice sandbox, one of the best single player (Can't get friends to play this) sandboxes out there. The game itself deserves a positive review, but since I bought it on PC to try out VR especifically i'm going to point out the reasons that I are making it hard or unpleasant to play. I will gladly change if more options are added to acoomodate the VR experience.\\n\\nOk, here goes my comments:\\n\\nI usually play all VR games that require a lot of hours to get thru seated.  I adjust my height so it feels natural, sit down on a swivel chair, and my preferred motion scheme is smooth locomotion with smooth turning.  This works out GREAT in games like Skyrim and OrbusVR. It lets me sit comfortably, without losing any of the mobility that would be crucial to playing it properly, and at the same time allows for longer playsessions. \\n\\nNo Man's Sky tries to offer these locomotion settings, but the implementation is very poor at the moment. The sensitivity on the smooth turning makes it almost impossible to not get a little bit sick, it's just too sensitive, and its all or nothing. The games that do this best usually scale the turning speed to how far from the center of the touchpad your finger is. This lets you control exactly how you are turning, making the experience a lot better. \\n\\nAlso, let us use the left touchpad to move. Touching it to move, letting us strafe with it. If i press left on the touchpad it should strafe me left, up move forward, back move backwards. Ideally just the touch should move you, and if you press it should be considered a sprint.\\n\\nThis makes it SO much easier to move around, and gives you full control over the character. It goes a long way to make the locomotion smooth.  Pressing the trigger to move is so unintuitive, it makes it a pain to move around and feels AWFUL.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\nNow for the spaceship controls.  They are perfect in terms of responsiveness.  I really felt like I had the controls in my hand. My onloy comment is, usually when you are flying a ship with a stick, when you turn it left you expect to roll, and the touchpad should serve as a rudder, strafing the ship left or right. This should at least be an option. Would make it feel so much more real when flying.\\n\\n-----------------------\\n\\nAs for the survival experience I have one more comment to make. \\n\\nI've had a Vive for a while now, and the one thing that is a constant for me when I play a normal game that went VR, be it Skyrim, Falltout 4, or Subnautica, is that you spend a LOT more time letting the scenery kick in. It's a much slower pace, you aren't always in a rush to get into your destination. \\n\\nWhen I playing skyrim I think i spent an hour alone in bleak falls barrows, the first dungeon, it's just a TRIP to look at every little detail in the environment around you. \\n\\nConsidering this, it would be nice if you could spawn VR players in less hostile worlds for the first landing. You die at least once just trying to get a hold of the controls your first time spawning, because unlike PC you don't want to frantically go after supplies to stay alive, hopping from cave to cave. It would be nice to even walk to destinations instead of running, and its just too steep of a cliff to drop someone in when they are immersed like that. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I think it would make the beginning of the survival experience a LOT more VR friendly. \\n\\n\\nI will be happy to try this again if these changes are ever put into the game. As of right now, I couldn't stand to get past the survival experience in the beginning, and had to load a save to use a spaceship. I am dying to get into my character, but the immersion just goes away with these controls.\",\n",

I\\'ll sit in the same place, facing the same direction, and the UI is always way off to the left or right when I start a new game.\\n5) Want to crouch down to pick up something on the ground? Be prepared for the game to start whining that you\\'re out of the play space.\\n6) The HUD that is projected in your \"helmet\" doesn\\'t move with your head.\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty clear that the VR mode was developed for sitting on a couch with PSVR and never moving your head, ever. The game treats VR as a stationary screen, but on your eyes. There was really no mind for PC VR systems or standing up and moving around.\\n\\nEdit: The latest update made some of the visual issues more bearable, but I have more frame rate drops than previously. Also can say again for certain that the controls were not developed with PC VR systems or smooth movement in mind at all.\\n\\n1) You are able to punch things by actually punching them with your controller. But the way the game was programmed, moving into things using smooth movement also somehow counts as a punch. Want to visually inspect something by getting close to it? Forget it. You\\'ll destroy it.\\n\\n2) It\\'s especially tough to fly the ship. The game basically puts the throttle and control stick inside my legs. I\\'ve done everything I can to reset the seated position, but to no avail. Also, the stick position is relative to whatever direction you grabbed it with rather than using the controller\\'s absolute position. Did you grab the stick with the controller horizontally expecting the stick to move to horizontal? Forget it. Now horizontal is vertical. It doesn\\'t make any sense.\\n\\nThis is one of the worst VR experiences I\\'ve had.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll start with the positive things. The most important thing: I had some fun playing the game. When you start you have so much to explore and discover that it can get you hooked for hours. You can gather resources, scan, upgrade your stuff, participate in space battles... and it is amazing at the beginning.\\n\\nSo, why did I give the negative review?\\n\\nWell let\\'s start with the not so good stuff.\\n\\nI played with friends and laughed. Not because we had so much fun but because it was the only possible reaction to keep some of our sanity. The game is riddled with bugs, some minor and some game breaking and some seem like a bug but the game is apparently designed that way.  There seems to be a bug in every second main quest that you have to work around. Quite frankly, I have seen Early access games with less bugs.\\n\\nSome of the bugs encountered in 36 hours of gameplay for strictly single player:\\n[olist]\\n[*] Falling through the space station floor and ending up in space which makes the game crash a few seconds after.\\n[*]Losing all of your units when buying another ship by trading in your own ship even if you had a lot  more than needed.\\n[*] Randomly losing quicksilver currency (don\\'t even know when or why it happened)\\n[*] Main quest markers in the middle of space where you have to delete some party of your base to fix it\\n[*] Don\\'t even get me started on the quest line with the base computer, especially if you have more than one. You  can only do the quest at one of them but if you use a built portal to get there fast, the quest marker  keeps changing the computer, so you actually have to travel there by ship. oh and please don\\'t do time gated quests in a fucking (mostly) single player game. Needing over 15 hours to do a questline that could have been finished in 1 hour because of time gating just makes it seem like they need to do it to make it seem like there is more content.\\n[*]Animals bugging out and not doing anything\\n[*]Aliens on space station lying on the floor without you being able to talk to any of them\\n[*]Materials sometimes disappearing from refiners\\n[*]Visor showing resource deposits where there are none (and no, it was not already mined)\\n[*]Not getting money from bounty missions\\n[*]Getting stuck in landing animation and having to restart the game\\n[*] Starting a conversation with aliens sometimes doesn\\'t show any text\\nand many more...\\n[/olist]\\n\\nmultiplayer bugs:\\n[olist]\\n[*]getting desynced so that you don\\'t see your friend in game without restarting the game\\n[*]When inspecting/comparing ships, the same ships have different values and inventory slots for you than for your friend\\n[*]Bounties for pirates have different values for you than for your friend (doesn\\'t matter as you don\\'t get paid anyway and the moment someone of you engages the ships, they disappear for your friend, so you can\\'t actually fight together)\\n[/olist]\\n\\nmultiplayer \"features\":\\n[olist]\\n[*] you can\\'t use the trade terminal at the same time\\n[*] you can\\'t talk to the same merchant at the same time (which is not even needed for synchronisation as the merchant has a separate inventory for each of you)\\n[*] You don\\'t even do the main story quests together, you do them one after the other. If someone starts a dialogue, the other one can\\'t do the same until you are finished.\\n[/olist]\\n\\nMain story line:\\n\\nI like a good story but this main story line is particularly unengaging, boring and repetitive. Sure, I am only halfway through the main story, but during that half it felt like I was doing the same quests over and over again and doing the same stuff I was already doing when exploring planets  just with 4-5 lines of, sometimes scrambled, story text added to it.\\n\\nIf you still want to play the game, go ahead, I had at least some fun, but I would certainly recommend you to not buy it at full price.',\n",

Quite a lot of content though, so that is good. A few mods are also there, to fix a few things, although since updates break those, most of them are no longer working. Expected more after hearing all that praise online, not gonna lie. I wonder how it was just after release, if, apparently, it’s so much better now.\\n\\nOh, and also, colliders for buildings are way bigger than visuals, much worse than it was in Fallout NV, for example, so bullets get stuck. And enemies can shoot through walls and pass through buildings, especially those robodogs, so can’t really take cover from those to take a bit of a break.

       "  'review': 'I started playing for first time ever because it is great new VR game. I have played about 60 hours and NMS has been working ok  up until today . Today it crashes often and is only playable if you do not mind restarting over and over from your last save. I have a great machine that allows me to run on high graphic setting in all game(VR chat,fallout 4,skyrim, call of the star seed...) I have played up to this game. This game I have turned graphics and resolutions all the way down and it still red lines my water cooled 1080ti. They really need to let us easily save whenever we want especially in this VR version and the opening sequence is fine once a day but 30 times a day is ridiculous and very time intensive.  It is a good game if they ever get it to a playable state.',\n",

       "  'review': 'TL;DR One of the worst, if not THE worst, single player experiences on Steam. One of the best, if not THE best, multi-player experiences on Steam.\\n$60? NOPE. $30? MAYBE. $15? TAKE MY MONEY!\\n\\nNot enough bad to be a \"No,\" but too much bad to be a straight out \"Yes\"\\n\\nThe UI isn\\'t that friendly as it places common commands/interactions behind several layers of navigation when they should really be a single keystroke, not to mention the menus are actually on timers (they will disappear on you after a few seconds of inactivity rather than closing on your command). This can be a pain early on when you have absolutely no idea where anything is in the menu or what it does. The tutorial leaves much to be desired as it has you do action-similar tasks step-by-step rather than giving an overall goal with a \"to-do list\" so you can complete the task more efficiently, e.g. repairing your starter ship, you are sent out to recover on component and then return to the ship for the tutorial to proceed to \"Step 2.\" Of course, you CAN go out and get all the materials, but only if you already know you can do this and know what you need to gather. \\n\\nVariety is SORELY lacking. I find this disconcerting as it was one NMS\\'s primary selling points. Planets quickly become indistinguishable as you slowly realize there are very few climates and only a handful of \"dangerous\" traits (I say \"dangerous\" because these hazards are easily overcome/avoided). Animals and plants are generally similar, although I don\\'t know if the common/uncommon/rare occurrence references the planet or the universe as a whole; you will find similar, even identical, species on multiple planets/systems. The limited selection in variations quickly leads to what seems to be copy-paste content despite being \"procedurally generated.\"\\n\\nCombat is lackluster. Animals are no real threat as most run off as you kill them. Sentinels, the primary defenders of valuable resources and commodities planet-side, are easily defeated/evaded; like GTA, just runaway or hide until your warrant level disappears and your back in business. Again, no real threat. Space battles aren\\'t that complex, they consist of pirates spawning because reason and you shooting them down. Their tactics are simple in that they speed straight towards you, aligning themselves to your line of fire, no aiming required. The random dogfight is hardly a fight as you simply sidestep, turn, and fire.\\n\\nResources are abundant and infinite; if you can\\'t find something just go to another planet/system, eventually you will find it in great supply. What makes them infinite is that they actually respawn after a short period. Find a rare mineral/resource? Hope you have the tech to mine it; be prepared to hold on to it as you\\'re going to have  to find a system with a station that values the find enough to pay you what it\\'s worth. Of course, having a freighter completely relieves the inventory concerns. Speaking of freighters...\\n\\nBase building is nearly pointless as far as I\\'ve experienced. Anything you can do on a base, aside from hiring a handful of aliens to \"work\" the base, can be done on your freighter which you\\'ll likely pick up in your first 10 hrs of play (10 hrs is a generous over-estimation as you will likely acquire one in the first system or two you explore). And if you DO decide to build a base, be prepared for physics defying overhangs, ugly corners, and unnecessary mechanics. All-in-all, this game sucks...\\n\\nThat is unless you\\'ve got some good friends to play with. While the game is incredibly tedious on your own, having a couple mates to fly around with adds a whole lot to the experience. Take you crew through system hoping adventure of discovery. Setup a mining colony to farm up some credits. Find and repair a crashed ship to add to your collection. Uncover the mysteries of the alien life forms that populate the universe. While these ALL deal with the negative aspects I find with the game, adding a multiplayer aspect is enough to gloss over those shortcomings. It has been my experience, however, that people don\\'t tend to trust those they don\\'t know in game so it doesn\\'t seem likely you will find many others willing to join up (admittedly this is anecdotal, but is accurate for the roughly 100 hours I\\'ve put into the game).\\n\\nIn summary, HG still has some serious work to do to make this the $60 title they promised at launch, but it is well on its way. For $30 you might consider picking it up if you have a few others to play with or don\\'t mind the mind-numbing repetition. On sale, it\\'s a definite buy.',\n",

The beyond update with VR is what finally pushed me to try it as it was on sale for half the price. I'm very disappointed. The controls are not very intuitive. The UI is bizarre at best and the flight mechanics are seriously lacking. I tried my best to enjoy it as I paid for it however I just couldn't get any fun from it.\\n\\nThe Flight mechanics (which I feel should be the main focus of the game) are absolute trash. Space combat in this game is like pulling teeth and I absolutely hate it. The game is very slow. VERY VERY SLOW. \\n\\nSeems like even after three years of development this game is a serious let down. I'll go back to having fun in Elite Dangerous\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit September 02.2019:\\n\\nI stay with thumbs down. \"No Man´s Sky\" wants to be everything. Gather resources and build stuff; explore and survive; ground and ship fighting...\\n\\nThere are 54 \"raw materials\" and 81 \"crafted products\". And the list of \"raw materials\" even includes refined materials! You can get most on your first planet. Go to a hand full and you have everything. There could be so much more ...\\n\\nGathering resources and building: You can only build bases and the design does feel kinda limited. If you wanna build stuff, try \"Empyrion - Galactic Survival\" or \"Space Engineers\". There you can build whatever you want / can imagine (as soon as you get used to it). Those games do have their own flaws, the gameplay itself is mediocre, but in terms of building they show how it is done.\\n\\nExploring and survival: Try \"Subnautica\". Realy short, but so great. I am waiting for \"Below Zero\". This is a great example what exploring and survival can be like. Oh, and a good plot you can actually care for...\\n\\nFighting: I don´t know. But fighting in \"No Man´s Sky\" is lame! So I can buy a Class S Fighter? Cool! But I take down every single enemie with my class C Shuttle (I bought just for transport capacity)... I get hit, shields are reduced... and then they just recharge. I get hit again, reduced, recharged... and so on. Oh, how exciting....    Nope!\\n\\n\\nSo: You want all of this in one game and you don´t care if every single concept isn´t well thought out? Then you can try \"No man´s sky\". If you want one or another concept to be realy good: Maybe try something else.\\n\\nI wanted to try myself, and now I think I should have listened to all the bad reviews and skipped this. I mean if you do not care for the money (if you spend hundreds of $ each year on games) you can try this game any way. If you have little money to spend and you realy have to decide what to buy, I would advise you to buy another game.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOriginal: I enjoyed some hours, some hours where boring as hell, some where frustrating. After all I have a mixed fealing...\\n\\n\\nMy main complains are:\\n\\nI flyed from space station to space station. All looked pretty much the same. Then I ran around and talked to all aliens. Each space station has one or two \"individuals\", that ask for something and you can choose an answer out of 3 options. The impact is low, but OK. After some time you will find the same \"individuals\" all over again.\\nAll of the other alliens are pretty much the same. They say something to greet you, you can ask them to teach you a new word and they will. You could give a gift to raise your reputation with their race, doesn´t matter which one you give it. And you can practice your language, giving you the option to choose one of 4 words, of which none will ever do something good. It´s either wrong or terribly wrong, causing loss of reputation. And thats it...\\nI do understand they are not able to programm millions of individual aliens. I just wish there was more to it than it is now. After some time I stoped talking to aliens at all, cause it was just boring. It´s cool to have a huge universe with so many aliens, but as it is now, it´s just as bad as if there where none... They are just like soulless creatures I couldn´t care less for.\\n\\nI startet exploring my starting planet and scanned every mineral, every plant, every animal. I loved it, what a cool feature... Then I flew to the next planet and scanned a lot. Then the next... OK. That is kind of borring too... You get some units for it, but I don´t need those. You get the entry, with little information and a pic. I stoped doing that too.\\n\\nThe universe is so big. Yet it feels so empty.. (OK maybe this is how space actually is, I don´t know. But this is a game, this should entertain me somehow...)\\n\\nThere are some other, small problems that bother me. Like when I make a wooden room, place a weapons terminal and the back flows in the air. I think this might just be wrong placement. So I replace it. Can´t place it properly. I search the forums. Find an entry from one year ago... They don´t seem to care to fix those little cosmetic \"issues\"... This is not game breaking, of course. But it makes my base a bit ugly, and base building is one of the aspects I actuelly like. And I think such things could be fixed...\\nWhen I place a floor, place something on the floor and the I realise, it looks better if I rotate the floor, I can remove the floor, but I cannot add it back without removing the thing on it first.\\nAnd so on...\\nSmall issues that add up. Just enough to get on my nerves.\\n\\nAnd if you start reading problems other players have at the forums... oh my.... Maybe some comments overdo it a little bit, I don´t know. But the game seems to have some serious issues...\\n\\n\\nThere are good stuffs though:\\n\\nAs I said, I like the base building. I gathered resources, started building, removed, rebuilded. The grind was OK, now I am able to simply buy resources. I got more and more things to build, needed more resources to do so. This is what I expected.\\nOf course, I do not spend a lot of time at my base, but I still like it.\\nAnd I really love that you can actually get aliens to your base! Doesn´t make your base feel so empty. Aliens that do have a character! Aliens that are not only soulless creatures! Oh how I wish there where more of those! Why not more of those?\\n\\nNow, with those aliens at my base I got some side quests and something to do, thats is good.\\n\\nAnd I like the trading aspect. At every space station I write down what they buy and sell (not all of it, only what I think is important) and I make a route, planing how to get good income. I wish they where more individual though. If they like product z, you know they also like product y and x... If they sell product z, you know they also sell product y and x... I´d like them to shuffle that to make it more interesting. But nevermind, making money is still one of the fun aspects of this game for me.\\n\\nOther ppl seem to really love the game as it is. (I hope they don´t tear me apart for not loving it the same way.)\\n\\n\\nAfter all, hard to say if I like it overall, but I´d rather say no then yes at the moment, cause I think I had more time being bored or frustrated than enjoying the game...\\n\\n\\nBUT:\\nI have 40h of gameplay as I write this rewiew. I think 40h should be enough to get a picture of a game. But maybe the game gets better if I keep playing? Maybe there are still a lot of interesting things to come I have not realised yet? If so, I am gonna change my rewiew to positive...\\nBut as it is now, I go with thumbs down so far, for making me play and play and play just for the hope it gets better...',\n",

The very next day I tried loading it up and nothing happened, it would say 'Running' and then 'Syncing' in the Steam Game Library and then it would just stop, nothing would happen. I updated my video card drivers, uninstalled and re-installed the game (three times), I even re-installed Steam. I also re-downloaded x64 from Microsoft. I had someone in detail help me out in the Steam forums with different possibilities such as my video card etc. and still nothing. I eventually found a YouTube video from last year stating if you unchecked the Steam Cloud save box it helped with the game not loading, still nothing. I then tried the experimental version of the game, still nothing.\\n\\nI have not been able to get this game to run for the life of me, and I have more than enough computer to run it. I even messaged Hello Games but all they said was to uninstall mods, I don't have any mods installed for the game.

Позже замечаешь что тоже самое касается флоры, фауны и техники (особенно фрегатов). С другой стороны исследовательская составляющая весьма неплохая и если бы не низкое разнообразие и тот факт что очень много чего прикрыто гриндингом, я бы поставил игре другую оценку.\\n\\nТаже самая поверхностная красивость с игровым процессом. Сперва шахтеришь на terrain луч, потом на улучшенный добывающий лазер, затем на телепортер чтобы руду было сподручней на корабль скидывать, сканер чтобы искать подземные залежи и базы ставишь в местах где удобней ресурсы добывать. Тоже самое наблюдается с репутацией и миссиями. И если в начале все нормально, то чем дальше тем больше получается вечный и медленный гринд ради того чтобы делать все эффективней без резких качественных скачков, этот гринд не приносит чувства прогресса и следовательно удовольствия. Есть тут и интересные аспекты, но увы не много.\\n\\nСценарий... Что-то неоправданно жесткое для такого мира. Мне предложили туториаол по постройке базы, так как планета была никакая и игра явно поддерживала множественные сценарии, я отложил постройку до следующий системы, вот только спустя пару часов оказалось, что чотобы получить миссию на гипердрайв этот сценарий таки надо выполнить. Еще пример: сценарные миссии которые шлют делать что-то в течении часа и в награду дают чертежи которые уже есть или же превращают игрока в принеси-подай и без разницы что нанитов с запасом на любую покупку хватит- иди добывай еще и именно в этом месте. \\n\\nНу и наконец баги. Их вагон и маленькая тележка, приследуют игрока с самого начала. От глючных контейнеров и дронов застревающих под землей до разбивания корабля при взлете с торговой наземной станции и базы котрая вдруг потеряла половину всего оборудования..\\n\\nПо мелочи: торговля, но очень базовая. Управление флотом, опять же базовое (игрок может только купить фрегат, удалить или тыкнуть ему в миссию) и принципиально ни на что не влияет кроме небольшой прибыли.\\n\\nP.S. Для VR игра не очень подходит, она очень затяжная, хотя посмотреть пару мест из гарнитуры интересно.',\n",

Well I did, on release, during the NEXT update and finally with BEYOND, and I\\'m happy to say that is the last damn time I will ever play this game.\\n\\nIf you\\'re into spending interminable amounts of time collecting random shite to build pointless \"bases\" then No Man\\'s Sky is for you. I would rather spend hours in a dentists chair without anesthetic as said DDS uses every tool in his extensive set on my toothypegs than spend another second in this trash pile.\\n\\nTo say the game is dull is a complete understatement, dull is practically a glowing response to this desperately dim fare. Whilst planets may have different attributes every single one is same old same old. The art style is cute and saccharine, and like anything overly sweet will quickly bore the living shite out of you. After an hour or two in No Man\\'s Sky, if you\\'re not craving something meaty then you may want to get checked by a doctor, diabetes is a debilitating disease.\\n\\nFor a game with Space Flight in it, but not at it\\'s core, the flight model is akin to dragging an asthmatic elephant through treacle by it\\'s tail. It\\'s clunky, responseless, and downright unintuitive. While the game itself sounds great on paper the execution of the mechanics, the game loops, and the interminable grind for materials to advance makes it feel like Star Citizen and Minecraft hate-fucked and this is mutated progeny.\\n\\nAvoid at all costs.

       "  'review': \"It doesn't take more than an hour of game play to realize that this game has both an amazing potential and is a complete failure still this long after release... So here is the pro's and con's \\n\\nPros: Game has a lot to offer in terms of exploring its vast galaxy, varied planets, and style of survival game play. Even the story so far seems interesting and gives a player a sense of objective. The variety of items, ships, and even owning a freighter and a fleet of frigates gives the player a sense of the vast universe and power that can be achieved in the game.\\n\\nCons: There are tons of glitch's and bugs that occur while playing. Flying is not easy and combat with sentinels can be fun and annoying... Modding, Crafting, and resource gathering can become very overwhelming fast and having multiple bases in the same system seems to cause a glitch with the base computer quest... also if you go off course of the primary mission it seems you end up missing essential freebies that you end up buying by accident. Even short cut keys can be annoying at times since some are default attached to multiple actions in the same window. Lastly if your frigates get damaged on a mission you have to go land directly on that frigate, bring the right resources, and repair the individual damaged locations which could waste 10 minutes of your time running around the frigate to find and fix them... cool the first time... annoying every time after.\\n\\nTo go over all the minor problems and bugs in the game would be a novel and I am only 40 hours in now. They are not game ending bugs or issues but they certainly can cause you to reload a few times or regret building an entire base. For example finding out that certain industry level mining buildings glitch and do not allow to gather certain resources can ruin a base location you chose. Hopefully the developers are still working on fixing these problems but at this current point it becomes tedious at times to work around these issues...\",\n",

Creative Mode players want more assets in this procedurally generate universe and more variety of planets, biomes, plants, trees, fauna and animals etc. We're tired of the annoying messages that pop up all the time . Why can't we have the option to turn off these messages, they are destroying the ambience of the game. We should have the option to roll back any updates to go back in time to play the older versions of the game, since Hello Games doesn't care about the people who play in Creative Mode who only want to explore.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game has so much potential. Each update adds more features that are very exciting (that were promised before the game ever released). Yet, each update seems to add more and more bugs, while not removing much of the ones that already exist. The most recent big update is a disaster, I've run into more bugs than I would expect even in an open beta. I've reported each one I've run into, submitting the reports through the No Mans Sky support site, and of course I haven't received any acknowledgement of these being received, nor any suggestions from any support team on how to overcome the game breaking obstacles I've encountered. I've thrown away millions of credits worth of work with the number of times I've died, or had to revert to a save file anywhere from 5 to 60 minutes old because of the games archaic save system (how can you justify having no autosave when teleporting between stations?) \\n\\nTo date, here are some of the bugs that I've encountered:\\n\\n-After using the command station on my freighter, ended up noclipped in the ceiling of my freighter, when trying to move back down, fell through the freighter completely, falling endlessly through space, until I collided with an asteroid and died, losing a full inventory. \\n-Walked into an outpost on my friend's system, and my game immediately crashed as soon as I looked at the Galaxy Trade Network access, losing 10 minutes of work since the game did not save anything recently \\n-Ended conversation with Mission NPC in space station, camera stayed glued to the NPC while I had control of my character. Due to my last save being 30 minutes earlier, I spent 5 minutes blindly controlling my character until I was able to successfully interact with the NPC again\\n-Camera got glued to a portal in a space station, could control my character but could not see them. Ended up walking off the edge into the area with space ships, was unable to recover by interacting with an NPC/object to reset UI, was forced to revert save, losing 40 minutes of trading progress. \\n-After trying VR (And hating it, the controls and performance are both rubbish) I returned to non-VR and the VR Guidance pop-ups have remained ever since. I have about 20 hours of game play with the bottom right corner of my screen telling me how to access the menu in VR by pointing my right hand to my left. Not game breaking, but absolutely obnoxious. \\n-Flew into the Anomaly to land, space ship ended up skipping around the station spinning erratically. Ended up seeing multiple players with this issue. Lost 30 minutes of progress. \\n-Found an abandoned base filled with alien eggs, shot the eggs from a long distance away which triggered the Abominations to spawn, which walked around normally then fell through the ground and immediately teleported to me, killing me instantly. full inventory lost. \\n\\nThis game has a lot of potential for fun, especially with friends, but is such an enormously buggy game that I still cannot recommend. If you do decide to play it, I strongly recommend carrying around portable save points & use your ship every time you change station. I'd also recommend not carrying around anything valuable in your inventory, because you never know when you're going to clip through something and die. \\n\\nTL;DR Fuck this game\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought this game launch day in 2016. Was fascinated for the 60+ hours I spent on it. I had come to the point where I could either 1. get to the center of the galaxy using hundreds of time consuming warps or 2. Find that illusive Atlas pass v3. I didn't have the patience for either after researching online what each rewards you with. \\n\\nJump to 2019 with the Beyond update. Sure, the game is far more polished with more to collect, build, farm, and upgrade but the end experience is still the same: It takes an eternity to reach the center of the galaxy (the only true goal in the game) and the only reason to collect and upgrade is to... collect and upgrade. This game has no conclusion, no progressive difficulty, and a story so vague and paper thin that you'll lose interest in it within the first hour or two.\\n\\nThat's not to say the game isn't worth playing. I've had some legitimately memorable moments with this game (finding an amazing looking planet, running into another player randomly, traveling 20 minutes to a facility and back on foot because I thought I needed to all while surviving the elements), but once the veil falls and you realize that this game is essentially just loading one random set of 1-5 planets with the same space station and the same randomized ships and randomized multitools and randomized but re-occurring fauna and flora every time you warp then the game feels incredibly small and meaningless. \\n\\nFor this reason I cannot recommend this game. Another game will come along by a AAA developer that does what NMS does but 100x better with a proper story and challenge.\",\n",

Even if I were to complete the first planet of this clunky snooze fest and repair my ship I'm certain mostly tedious farming on boring planets would await me... \\n\\nGod no, get subnautica, and if you played/liked subnautica don't ruin the genre for yourself with this steaming pile of garbage.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This is less a review than a rant, but I will be posting it regardless.\\n\\nI absolutely do not recommend playing this until some concrete and thorough bugfixes have been released. Beyond just the bugs making this unplayable even when saving at all opportunities, such as the space anomaly drifting bug, the freighter phase-through bug, and more than I could mention about the construction bugs, there are many features implemented that are often just hostile to the player.\\n\\nBase-building is a chore at best and involves plodding through many dialogue prompts hoping that the next will actually bring progress rather than another pointless and unskippable non-sequitur, all while many crucial base components are missing from your blueprints, such as a door being required to enter a hab-pod, but if it is powered, it remains shut. This would not be a problem if the blueprint for a door switch weren't locked behind several branches of a tech tree. Another issue with bases arises from any plot that must be excavated, with the excavation tools not only being an absolute ball-ache to use, but with there also being the chance that your plot will once again be buried by the pointless terrain regeneration. Any desire to slightly modify the arrangement of base components requires deleting the component in question and hoping you have the inventory space to hold the refunded materials. All of this for the privilege of powering a storage pod that is also a chore to access without the ability to take with you anywhere like those that may be installed on a freighter.  The only tangible benefit from using a base is ground vehicle deployment, which requires a base on any planet you wish to use them on, which is a far cry from being a net positive result of the system.\\n\\nAll of this and more considered, I can honestly say I prefer the launch build of the game; it may have had problems, but that was from lack of content, not nigh-malign additions.\",\n",

Software-bugs everywhere.\\n\\nThe game would be decent if the game wasn't riddled with bugs.\\nIt appears the studio who produced the game just pushed for more content and never fixed very basic bugs. There are storage bugs, bugs where you will fall through the floor of your main ship, bugs where you will lose your ship while paying full price for another, bugs in conversation scripting and item delivery, bugs in item operation, bugs in item interaction.\\n\\nThere are poor coding decisions where you can consume an item to look for local instances of a certain type of building/item where if it is not found, the item is still consumed rather than returned. There are issues with occasional hard-faults. There is a manual-save function in the game which forces you to either build or bring a save structure to everywhere you go to save. It is necessary to save prior to any important interaction because of the bugs in the game. While playing this game you get used to taking steps to ensure you can backup to previous states and lose a fair amount of time.\\n\\nAs it is, this game is aggressively average.\\nIf time was taken to correct all of the bugs in this game it would be good.\\nIf the game had been coded to be massively-multiplayer and were bug-less it would be great.\",\n",

(I know what you\\'re thinking, but no; it literally did not allow me to interact with it. I held E and the white circle filled up, but then it didn\\'t open the menu. It also didn\\'t allow me to pick it up again.)\\n- After restarting the game, in an attempt to fix the previous bug, it no longer allowed me to play multiplayer because according to NMS there was not a single lobby, even though friends were definitely in one. They were also unable to invite me.\\n- To try and fix the previous problem, I continued my save file in singleplayer to make an attempt at making progress. I finally was able to use the refinery and I actually made some progress! I then yeeted myself to the next planet, where the game crashed when trying to load some text. Straight to desktop.\\n\\nFantastic.\\n\\n(Aside from this, I feel like it runs way worse than it should, but I don\\'t really have anything to back that feeling up with so I might just be overlooking something.)',\n",

No thanks!\\n\\nOtherwise the few hours i did before the latest update was enjoyable. But as i\\'m not even able to load the game with AV enabled i have to give it a thumb down.\\n\\nUpdate: \\nAs of 3rd of september, two weeks after initial review the game still has the Steam app load error that comes from Antivirus program preventing it to load. So yes i know how to come around the issue, by turning off the AV program i use. This means i still haven\\'t been able to play since that \"latest\" patch, plenty of patches has been released since the major one, which is great i guess, but none that solved the AV issue. \\nTherefor my recomendation stays with a thumb down.\\n\\nUpdate 2: 12th of september, still not able to load the game, a few days back i sent a report about the issue to Hello games in hopes something will be done to it.',\n",

Although, the main issue here isn't the content, but the inconveniences and poor functioning. To begin, there are frequent crashes that cause me to loose an hour of progress, (ex. building a base) where the only point of return is if you're lucky enough to be in your ship beforehand. I don't have much time in my day to be repeating lost progress. One issue that really bothered me, and a mistake I made multiple times, is fueling refiners and power generators without loosing 1,000+ of carbon on accident. Where it only lets me use the entirety of it, regardless if I separate it into smaller stacks. I could list more, but I would highly recommend listening to the community closely and fixing these. Besides that, the idea is really cool and I would have loved to involve more of my time into the game's future content. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this game at the moment, it still requires a lot of work and the attention should be more surrounded by making the game playable before adding new content. I do acknowledge and appreciate the effort in trying to revive this, yet sadly it's still lacking.\",\n",

So everything I am about to say is related to the VR version of the game since I have not played the regular version at all. \\n\\nNot that I played the VR version either, all the time played that you see above has been spent trying to get this unoptimized mess of a game to run semi decently wihout reprojection or shimmering pixelated jaggies everywhere.\\n\\nAfter a week of troubleshooting I can safely say I am giving up. I cant get above 45 FPS with a GTX 1080 and an i7 9700k, I have followed every guide, done every potential fix but it looks like the VR PC version of this game has been given literally 0 thought and slapped on just to reach a broader audience of wallets. I am trying to run this on a Valve Index, I have not tried other headsets with it.\\n\\nThis is a PSVR port that runs like shit, looks like shit and is unplayable as of mid August. If this changes I will change my review, but I am not holding my breath.\\n\\nEdit as of November: \\n\\nLiterally nothing has been fixed, its still a disaster. Don't bother with this.\",\n",

The last time it happened was when I was deleting an electric wire and attached a wire to my teleporter to go back to my main base.

Check out the reddit page for all the info on bugs at NoMansSkyTheGame subreddit.\\n\\nI bought this game back in the day on release. I did a chargeback because it was grade a garbage. I bought it after some improvements were made. Not a full fledged game, more like a novelty item at the time. Then this Beyond update comes out and we still have bugs that completely render harvesting useless, that have been around for years, never being fixed while they release even MORE content that creates an enormous amount of crashing. Setting the crashing aside, the amount of content this update broke is just unfreakinbearable.\\n\\nDon't even get me started on information about gameplay mechanics. There is so much conflicting crap on the wiki that you don't even know half the time what is current and what is not current gameplay mechanics. I've spent more time OUTSIDE the wiki, looking for information about gameplay mechanics and how to resolve long outstanding bugs that have never been fixed yet.\\n\\nI have tried to give this game the chance it deserves. As of right now, it is a playable product. It is not a well fleshed out product to play. I really hope it improves.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I had to uninstall. I lost all my faith in the game after BEYOND has been released.\\nWay too much core-breaking bugs and glitches. I thought I bought a game that was released in 2016, instead I got a game which seems it hasn't even been released to beta-state yet. Trying to play a game that seems more like I'm trying out a pre-alpha is a disgrace.\\nI played the game pre-Beyond, when it was (still) a buggy mess, but it was still more or less playable. But after, it just broke my heart and soul, to think I tried my best to trust the promises of a company that has not been able to deliver anything they've promised since day 1.\\nI might return some day in the distant future, to see if they've delivered finally a game worth the 31€ that I bought this game with. The hell I'd pay the full 60€ for a disgrace like this.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The worst game I have ever played. I bought it last year in August and still can´t play it, because remapping of buttons doesn´t work.\\nThe main problem is deleting stuff. So as a newby I collected too much and my inventory is full, which requires me to discard something, which is not possible. The delete action is tied to pressing mouseweel, which doesn´t work for me. Rebinding it also doesn´t work, regardless what button I choose it always resets to standard setting immediately.\\n\\nWell, when I bought the game I thought this might be fixed at some point, since rebinding keys is kind of an important feature, right? No? Well, it doesn´t seem to be important for these devs, since it still doesn´t work.\\n\\nSo I can´t play the game! Thx at Hello Games! Great devs..\\n\\nI can´t express in words how much I regret buying this game, for me it´s scam from both Hello Games for not fixing gamebreaking issues and Steam, from Steam because they don´t refund me this game although it has a serious technical issue that prevents me from playing it. \\nI tried to explain to the steam support that I can´t proceed to play this game due to this issue but they do not even read what you write. They just look at the playtime and how long you own the game, which is not fair at all, since the problem occured after the refund period of two hours and I just waited to see if the developer fixes the issue, which he didn´t in over half a year.\\n\\nWhere I come from consumers are protected against such shady anti consumer practices but on Steam everything is possible as it seems.',\n",

Every single step you take in this game requires some sort of grind, BREATHING requires a grind for materials. You have to spend 5 minutes of mining just to build one room for a base. Oh you upgraded to a cool moon rover that you can take around and mine things with? Awesome except for the fact that you use up so many damn resources in the process that all you're going to be able to do is mine for more fuel to power the thing which you need to go get more materials so that you can THEN put those stupid materials in a refiner to make one component of a base then do it all over again.\\n\\nHello Games you need to release some of the grip on players. Yields need to be doubled or mats required to build things need to be halved. You ave made the game waaaay too complicated for it's own good  to the point that it's pushing new players away. There is nothing fun about spending a half hour mining stuff just to get to the point where I can buil a few things for my base. It wasn't nearly this complicated in the beginning. Every single update has changeed things so much, for no apparent reason, that we have to relearn the game every time. It's time consuming, tedious, complicated, things to play out smoothly meaning that you could go days of playing without acquiring certain necessary tools to make things A TAD bit faster. \\n\\nLearn from Subnautica, a far superior base building/survival game in a very similar style, that things DON'T NEED TO BE SO DAMN COMPLICATED TO BE FUN. Strip the stupid refiner out of the game, make things require raw mats to end the nonsensicla amount of steps it takes to build things, so that I can go out and do things that are FUN like exploring and base building, upgrading tools etc.\",\n",

The New Patch Today Made It Worse. My Hope is They are in Studio Working right now on Fixing this Game. It will be fun. VR Yesterday worked fine. BUT it has problems too. Played last night after VR in flat Panel mode and had a good time. Today it Patched and so far has caused 12 Crashes lol  it's Broken. Don't pay full price on this Game yet. Or do if you have faith they will get it right. I feel bad that after a new patch Today it's so much more worse then before. Sad but True. Make up your mind it's your Money. I think it will be fun if they can fix it. I run a AMD 7 and a RTX 2070 Factory OC Gigabyte Card with 16 G of System Mem. I have changed all the settings to run tests on my system to give it the CHANCE to work. It Didn't. IT's Broke for now.\",\n",

None of the key binds will work. It\\'s impossible to rebind the keys or even see what the keys functions are in game. The most basic of things a game requires has been ignored to work on graphic glitches while leaving the game completely unplayable without even a mention of whether it will be patched or not. The game is completely uncontrollable with the keyboard. \\n\\nI had limited time to request a refund from Steam for this game that should be renamed \" Beyond Broken \" so couldn\\'t waste time gambling on whether the developer would even reply to customers who have reported the problems to them or try to patch it. I received my refund and washed my hands of it. Don\\'t waste your money on this, any developer who ignores customers complaints constantly doesn\\'t deserve the custom.',\n",

I just hope they keep on making it better so i can someday change this review.\\n-A lot of bugs that affect gameplay, some really badly.\\n-Exploring the planets is the very idea of the game but way procedual generation works on this is that everything is basically the same with different flavors. There are no really high or low places ,worlds\\' \"bottom\" is really close to the surface and everything is spread out quite evenly so different areas of the planet are pretty much the same. \\n*A lot can be remedied with mods\\n-each planet has its own ecosystem which is good ((flora,fauna,geology)all of it can be renamed). They all might be gray placeholders because not one of their traits mean anything which is bad. Also all planets have some default plants which always look and function the same and can be renamed as if they were something new. Not horribly gamebreaking but very lazy in game that is all about exploring and finding new things.\\n-you can\\'t stop with your ship. You literally can\\'t stop unless you land.\\n-lack of enemies.On planets there are these robot things called sentinels, some wildlife can be aggressive (so far they have just charged and tried to swipe), some plants (the default ones that are always the same) can do damage. Thats about it that I have seen so far. Maybe there are more closer to the center but i doubt it.\\n-I think base systems(there are 3, planet, capital ship and spacestation) have still unclaimed potential.\\n\\nThere are also a lot of good things about the game, but you can read about them on the other reviews.\\n\\nConsidering how badly this game launched yet still the devs persisted there is still hope for the game to live up to its hype.\\nIts now at 50 / 100 on my scale.',\n",

There are so many quality of life updates that could massively improve this game. Being able to skip through dialogue would be a great first start. Having to wait through roughly 10 seconds of some stupid text box saying the same damn thing 20 times while you trade in navigation data for maps is just idiotic. Who designed that and then proceeded to ignore the criticisms from no doubt thousands of people?\\n\\nThe glitch where you can lose control of your bases are also great fun. I enjoy losing progress just because I used a portal on the nexus. I saw people posting about that back in 2016. How does a game just utterly fail to fix major bugs like that and somehow still put out major content updates? My mind is boggled. I luckily was able to recover my base by reloading a save, so I guess this game is somehow more reliant on stability saves than some 20 dollar minecraft in space game made in unity like empyrion.\\n\\nOn top of the above, progress is slow and fairly unrewarding. The only big jumps appear to be unlocking prefab rooms which are the only ones where the more advanced tech can be placed for some reason and buying a freighter.\\n\\nAt least it looks cool.\",\n",

There's one there)\\n\\n Things are either bad or Drove me crazy:\\n1)Still major glitches (Example the entire space station and anomoly disappeared leaving me floating in midair)\\n2)Don't bother building anything worth keeping. Twice in two days it has taken away my base setting it to guest) That means no additional building allowed)\\n3)Don't bother with the storage vault its huge with only a capacity for 5 items and it requires power to put things in and get things out.\\n\\nIt's come along way since it's initial release. These errors especially no.2 have been known to the community based on a recent search for awhile. Which means the either the developers don't care or don't know how to fix. Either way this makes part of the enjoyment of this game obsolete. Not sure how this breaks since the base computer has your name as the last person to edit. So I'm pretty sure a check that matches the current player name to the base last edited name to determine the players permission to edit should be simple logic to incorporate. Even putting a claim button to relink it should.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I really want to like this game a lot, and I have thought long and hard about whether to dip my toe in again, but can't bring myself to do so. The biggest problems for me, ones others have touched on, are too big to ignore. It's a really huge grind, and things feel tacked on just to keep you grinding. Dumb enemies without any personality, like the repetitive Sentinals, who are just there to annoy you at every turn (cos who doesn't like being harassed continuously while they try collecting and building) dampen any previous enthusiasm. I'd not mind as much if there was more variety of challenging enemies, which had various ways to deal with them.\\n\\nThe universe lacks personality, and in fact the biggest problem with it, is there's too much of everything.\\n\\nYOU SEE SOOOO MUCH. The emptiness of space is not depicted here, it's teeming with life, and so things become stale very quickly. If Hello had the nerve to hold things back, there might be genuine excitement when discoveries are made, out of the blue. Always knowing that there are things out there no-one has seen, waiting to be discovered, is what makes games like these special, it's why we enjoy them. But here, everything is thrown at you right from the off. Holding back is great, but only if you are giving us things that don't become wallpaper, and things that seem (even if they aren't really) unique. \\n\\nIt's a shame because there is a lot to love about the game, but in it's eagerness to give us lots of stuff, we only really get a small amount of genuine surprises, and a heck of a lot of chores to do.\\n\\nNote: Recently came back to this game to try the VR aspect. Turns out that the VR component is a jerky, stuttering, horrible mess on my Oculus Rift S/RTX 2070. I have good VR experiences generally, even if not always perfect, but here it was unplayable no matter what settings I changed. Oh don't forget to remember - every time you change a graphical setting, you have to restart the game, aagh! \\n\\nGreat potential.... maybe one day.\",\n",

But then I heard that the game was fixed, that the devs put in the extra hours to deliver on their promises, so I decided next time it was on sale I would give it a chance. Well I just picked it up for 30 USD and after twelve hours of play I feel nothing short of sucker punched. I am a busy individual, with only on average about 20 hours of recreational time a week. I spent twelve of those hours this week enjoying this game, only to find a damaged craft, attempted to add it to my collection, and wind up stuck with no working ship in the middle of bumf**k nowhere with no resources and no way to reload an earlier save except for one from all the way back at about half an hour into my playthrough.\\nTo be clear, if i was working on something for my job for the same amount of time I lost, I could have bought the game 6 times over. Since I value my free time, that is the value I blame this game for removing from my life.\\nIn hindsight, worst purchase ever.

There seems to be ZERO point to anything you do as all you will be doing is grinding to become more efficient, so you can grind some more. Add some travelling and you have NMS game play loop in its entirety, and it is all very easy, even when you first start out, because little to nothing will hinder your ability to do the only thing this game really has to offer, GRIND. The only \"challenge\" this game offers is managing your inventory. There is NO risk/reward factor, and the only time you ever really feel good about anything you have done in this game is when you build a sweet base, but that is basically ALL there is, unless you want to explore the overwhelming number of procedurally generated planets. Which I will say can be beautiful and cool looking from time to time, but that sense of beauty and coolness will wear off fast, then your back to the game play loop of grinding just to sight see, and grind some more. This game is entirely too based around being JUST a sandbox, and because of this, you have to make up your own fun too a degree iv never experienced in a game before. Even a game as similar and simple as Minecraft has challenge and reward. Why do non of these updates for NMS address the only real problem this game has suffered from since day 1?

But that's a low bar. \\n\\nNMS is a mash up of serveral different genre's. It's an RPG, shooter, space exploring, walking simulator.

After several game crashes and buggy quests (one person could only complete quests playing as the host in their own game), we finally all made it to the anomaly and started a group quest. Upon starting the group quest and setting out on flight to the target planet, one friend's game crashed again and when he logged back in he couldn't join us.

Some of these bugs are ofc depending on current system and not everyone will experience the exact same bugs that i do.

Game lagged like crazy until i found a way to manipulate the CPU core usage in one of the game files in the game folder.\\n2. A planet with one of my bases changed weather and sentinel status from neutral to aggressive all of a sudden. \\n3. A friend of mine had the game crash every time he died. Which you do alot first hour of play on survival if you are new. Way to steep learning curve for absolutely no reason btw...\\n4. Its common to fall/bounce through floors/walls/floating mountain structures. Both for you and the alien creatures. \\n5. Invisible walls appearing every now and then at places you know there shouldnt be one. Like for instance, when I save and log out when im in my freighter (its like your capital ship), I keep getting locked into rooms or finding invisible walls in the corridors. Several times ive had to rollback to last autosave. Autosave doesnt happen that very often, and in this case its kinda bad having to loose an hour or so of game time. \\n6. Able to sometimes duplicate items when moving items stacks between inventory and storage facilities. \\n7. Terrain manipulation sometimes working, sometimes not. Sometimes it resets instantly, sometimes it gets graphic bugs, sometimes instanly, sometimes you go away for a few minutes and come back to some really weirld looking spikes through the ground.\\n8. Bases does not always keep out weather effects and keep oxygen inside, eventhough they are complete with floor, walls and roof. \\n9. Your base does not tend to look the same to your multiplayer buddy. The game doesnt seem to sync properly with terrain/building parts and parts like trees and stones etc. \\n10. Sometimes after repairing your partly broken frigate (a ship that you can send out on missions for you) and get the \"repair complete\", you can still be able to find other broken parts for some reason. \\n11. Sometimes you cant move items from your storage to your inventory. Unless! You find the tiny pixel on the item icon that still works. Just imagine wanting to start a game or a program from the icon on your Desktop in windows. But it only works clicking the icon if you find 1 pixel on that whole icon. At first you think its completely broken but then you realise its only 99.9999% broken. Such a relief...\\n12. Short distance portals seems to work about 33% of every first time you try it and maybe only one way. After that it usually stops working completely. \\n13. Sometimes when close to an object while flying your space ship, the game seems to think you are stuck to the object and you start taking ship damage eventhugh you\\'re clearly not that close. \\n14. Sometimes you take random damage from or get stuck in ladders. \\n15. Hit boxes on stones or trees and stuff isnt always correct. So when trying to mine it, it doesnt work properly. \\n\\nI think i could go on forever.... I think you get the point. The game is more than broken at this moment and not worth the money.

       " 'This is the third time I’ve launched No Man’s Sky and attempted a play through. I love games where I can find a niche n a universe and go there away from real life and just live there for a time.  I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of a huge procedural universe. I keep coming back to NMS and I really want to live in their universe. Each time I come back it’s a heck of a lot better than the last time, but the is something missing. It just feels empty. \\n\\nHistory:  \\nThe first time I played was just after Beyond came out. Steam had a sale. A friend of mine and I bought the game and jumped in.  We spend maybe 5 hours fumbling with the clunky ui. We died like 10 times in the first 5 minutes. Then we figured out how to get sodium and oxygen and the challenge was over. After our first session my friend gave the game back and got a refund through Steam. I decided to keep the game with hopes that I might one day go back. \\n\\nThe second time I went in alone and was determined to endure beyond the clunkieness and find out if there was something I was missing beyond the learning curve. I worked through the story line, visited a few planets, started building my first base… Let me interject right here. Base building is my thing. I have over 4000 hours in Ark: Survival Evolved all of it on official pvp servers grinding out resources and building huge defensive functional bases. Life is Feudal, Haven and Hearth, Sub Nautica, even in Skyrim base building was my favorite part. But, the base building in NMS was so restrictive and the resource grinding so fumbly, bumbly, and boring I left halfway through my first wooden base and went back to Ark. \\n\\nPresent:\\nThird time is a charm? I still loved the idea of the game. While watching Internet Historian’s YouTube video on NMS, I laughed, I cried, (gaaaaay) and I decided to give NMS another go. Things have gotten significantly better. But….\\n\\n\\nThe good (Yes there is some good now): \\n1.\\t The options for base build are incredible. I was totally impressed with the number of options and the freedom. The system has been totally transformed for the good in comparison with my precious attempts at playing. It has so much potential. \\n2.\\tThe UI is less clunky and I am starting to understand the vision.\\n3.\\tIt’s huge.\\n4.\\tThe star ships, freighters, and frigates are super cool. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n1.\\tThere are no significant challenges. You die a few time in the first few minutes then it’s a handheld cake walk.\\n2.\\tThere is no reason to build a base. Maybe for elemental protection if you build on a hazardous planet. But, you can just jump back in your star ship and fly up to your freighter. \\n3.\\tInventory management is more than half of the game. Moving things from one inventory to another and back again over and over again. It’s not fun, it could easily be streamlined, but I think the developers are afraid if they removed the tedium of the inventory the game would have no challenges at all. \\n4.\\tThey’ve introduce a story to the game, but it’s an afterthought. It more like a long drawn out tutorial. The character are unmoving, the missions are boring, and I just going through the motions to get the upgrades. \\n5.\\tThe game feels dead despite all attempts to make it appear to be alive. For instance I’m standing on the surface of a planet that I just discovered naming all the plants and animals and every 5 minutes a squadron of faceless nameless NPC space ships fly over my head, Yet in the Anomaly, a space station where players from all over the enormous galaxy can go to meet and hang out, I can’t find anyone willing to talk to me. There aren’t even trolls! What, what, what!\\n6.\\tThere is no danger of loss, no planning necessary, or consequences for bad choices at all. For example in space there are asteroids everywhere. I mean everywhere. A constant cloud of asteroids filling the void between planets. But, these asteroids aren’t real. You can fly your ship right through them. You shoot them and get some resources. One of which is the fuel you need to travel between planets. So, there is no chance of running out of gas between planets. Let’s face it if you did run out of gas between planets you could always just reload a save game and start back at base. Or spend the twenty real time minuets it would take you to get to the next planet. But, those consequences are too dire hence the fog of ghost like asteroids. \\n7.\\tThe graphics are not good. The draw distance is horrible. I have a good rig. Walking across the surface of the planet the vegetation would pop in right in front of me and the animals some times wouldn’t register until I was already past them. Empty in front of me, turn around and oh! there are all the animals. \\n\\nIn conclusion: When I started writing this review my intention was to be mostly positive with a few critiques. But, when it came time to list the things I like about it I just couldn’t think of many and when I started writing about the things I didn’t the flood gate burst open. So, there you have it. If you already own NMS and you want to check out the new features go for it. The game is indistinguishable from the game I first played. If you don’t own it, I wouldn’t buy it. It’s a gigantic boring universe that I am leaving once again.',\n",

The game has some resemblance to the feel of Subnautica, which made me hopeful. The soundtrack is mostly uninteresting and bland.

It\\'s unfortunate, because it means that, initially there is one \"right way\" to play this \"sandbox\" game. For me so far, the story has only gotten in the way. It might be forgiven, but the story it\\'s self is not particularly interesting. I\\'d rather do my exploring in peace and after I\\'m more or less content, I\\'d go looking for the story and quests.\\n\\nThe game seems to have content, but I\\'m yet to find out, for how long will it entertain (39 hours played). It may last yet, as the game offers content at a very slow pace. The enjoyment per hour leaves something to be desired.\\n\\nThe start was slow and un-intuitive. The building menus were overwhelming. I\\'ve gotten mostly used to it, but the UI is a bit complicated at times, or at least unconventional. UI seems to be optimized for a controller, not keyboard. \\n\\nThe idea of \"learning\" alien languages is sort of interesting, but it\\'s slow and after almost 40 hours in, it has mostly lost its charm. I still don\\'t have nearly a full vocabulary of even the first language. You learn one word at a time and the word is never the one you need for context. I found it amusing that the alien language had words for \"a\" and \"the\", and both had to be learned separately.

I didn\\'t have the materials or technology to completely fix it, but I was exited to work towards fixing the ship and making her fly. It would have been a fun and meaningful goal at just the right time. Imagine my disappointment when I come back with the first set of supplies and find the ship gone! Despawned! The first major bit of interesting gameplay content stolen from me. \\n\\nAfter searching the forums, it is currently a \"feature\" of the game.

Sometimes NPCs walk through walls or eachother. My base has despawned and needed reloading the planet (teleport out and back). There are several glitches that enable infinite cash or materials.\\n\\nGRAPHICS\\nGraphics look nice. I like how the rings of ringed planets are visible from the surface and the planets have day and night cycle, but you can always fly on to the opposite side, where the time of day is different. There are nice weather effects, on planets that have weather to speak of. Overhead clouds cast shadows on the ground.\\n\\nIt required some tinkering to get running \"well\" (almost 60 fps avg (50-75 fps)) on my R5 1600 and RX580 at 1440p. V-Sync was on by default. Disabling it helped a lot. I have FreeSync anyway. Also I had to disable HBAO. The minimum requirements give a wrong impression. A low end machine may run this, but it will not look like anyting modern.\\n\\nVERDICT\\nI\\'m on the fence with this one. There obviously is tons of stuff in the game, but the experience is lacking. There are too many bugs or unpolished features. I won\\'t say you shouldn\\'t buy this. I\\'m saying, you should know this if you buy the game. I didn\\'t pay the full price, thank God. I got it on sale for 27-ish €. I will continue playing and hoping my review is adventually proven wrong.\\n\\nI sincerely hope the devs polish the game.

Seems like a good time to try NMS. Well, I played for less than two hours so i'll ask for a refund. NMS is definitely not for me. Here I will outline why and maybe it helps someone make a decision.\\n\\nThe highest gameplay level (the thing you do on a moment-to-moment basis) is very boring. You do 3 things:\\n1. Walk around and collect resources by clicking on things\\n2. Fly on your spaceship.\\n3. navigate menus and menus and more menus\\n\\nApart for item 3, writing it out like this makes it sound promising, but the implementation falls flat. The first two items are trivial. Walking around is understandably trivial but flying a spaceship? that's such a wasted opportunity to introduce interesting gameplay mechanics and challenges. Unfortunately it's the most trivial aspect of the game. You point and the ship goes. Zero regards for physics, which I understand is a matter of opinion, but at least that would add challenge to the game. Acquiring orbit, matching velocities, docking, landing etc. These things are rewarding to master, add a dose of challenge and real risk, which in turn would validate resource gathering for repairing or improving maneuverability. These things could be acquired without realism too, but it needs to be much more than point and go.\\n\\nAs is, the only motivation given by direct gameplay to gather resources is to... gather more resources. The storyline tries to motivate that by giving you a trail to follow. Signals left behind by someone or something. Interesting, but that doesn't hold on its own.\\n\\nThe third item, menu navigation, needs to be included in such a list because there is so much of it! And it's clumsy as hell too. It's just such a boring thing to be doing in a game that advertises itself as a space exploration game.\\n\\nAnd without challenge in flying, the exploration game mode is a hard sell too. It's a glorified atlas of a procedural universe. For that purpose one could do better with Space Engine, in my opinion.\\n\\nNone of this makes the game inherently bad, just not for me. If you are the kind of person who enjoys navigating menus to craft things that can be used to craft more things, give NMS a chance. I don't mean it sarcastically, it just sounds like it because I really don't like doing these things lol\",\n",

I love a good survival base builder and have given No Man's Sky a good while since release to iron out the bugs and game play issues. At least so I thought.\\n\\nEverything about this game feels unpolished and unfinished. The ship flight is clunky and almost feels like a mini-game, the story mode is very poorly written and often leaves you questioning exactly what it is you're supposed to be doing. The space navigation system is poorly implemented and a chore to use. The resource gathering is riddled with bugs and feels little more than a grind. The 'unique worlds and creatures' feel repetitive and uninspiring. There was almost nothing about this game that I found enjoyable, and I usually love this kind of title.\\n\\nSeveral specific issues I personally encountered that were particularly annoying to me were the following:\\n\\n- when you mine a resource it almost always claims to still be present and doesn't disappear from the scanner HUD. I've read several post of people claiming that it's because you have to remove every single part of the resource from the ground first (a terrible design choice in the first place if that was the case) but even after meticulously removing what I'm mining I always perform a local scan to discover that the game still thinks a little bit of resource remains in thin air (and this continues after attempting to mine the thin air every way possible). This is effectively game breaking for a base building and resource gathering game.\\n\\n- more than once when mining through terrain to get to a location (a handy way to travel on worlds with environmental hazards) I've had the tunnel around me vanish resulting in me falling to my death. This game is supposed to be several years into release ... not in alpha.\\n\\n- Creatures or hazardous plants being able to still kill me through terrain if I am in a tunnel.\\n\\n- Very roughly 1 in 4 times when I'm attempting to travel to find resources using the visor scanner, I get to the site to discover it's just a lump in the ground with no actual resource there.\\n\\nI honestly can't see how this game has a single positive review.

If you can procedurally generate a planet with points of interest, it must be possible to generate a map as well. That would also help with exploration.\\n- In-system navigation.

There is simply no way to sugarcoat it. Please look at some 4X games (e.g., Stellaris) to see how it can be done properly.\\n- Base building vs. exploration: This game does not seem to be able to make up its mind if it wants to be an exploration game (the storyline mostly indicates that) or a base building game (which a lot of missions indicate). I could, of course, build bases all over the galaxy, but to what end?\\n- Space combat. Ugh. I almost got nauseous trying to shoot down planes. It may be realistic-ish, but it is bad.\\n- The lack of technology improvements. Scanning takes the same amount of time in the beginning as it takes in the end. Inter-planetary travel hardly improves.\\n- Language learning. I see almost no difference between the original translator, and the upgraded version. I am not even sure what the translator does, as I still need to learn the language one word at a time.\\n- The repetitiveness of everything. After having seen 20 planets, I had mostly seen it all. I am scanning the same plants and minerals over and over again, because somehow they are a little different than the same-looking ones from the previous planet. I keep shooting asteroids because fuel efficiency improvements are meh. I keep mining ferrite dust, carbon, etc., because my warp cell only lasts 5 jumps. I keep walking endlessly to mine stuff because somehow my spacecraft cannot show me where the deposits are on the planet. And so on.\\n\\nThe ugly:\\n- Cut scenes. Endless cut scenes.

Due to the poor navigation interface, it is very difficult to have any idea of where you are and/or where you are going.\\n- Lack of storage space.

You can build and build and destroy all life that is current rendered in your current planet that it causes no problem. There is no penalty for killing fauna or harvesting flora too much. You go out to space, in to the planet, and everything is there again.\\n\\n- Following the same idea, when you clean up an area to build your base (like removing small rocks and plants), if you go out to space and return it will be filled with all those rocks and plants you just removed.\\n\\n- The dialog and story is pathetic. It\\'s not just bad, it is filled with generic meaningless dialog with no voice-over and with no sense at all. It is slow, you have to smash buttons to fast forward and sometimes you have to take actions that makes no difference in the end, the NPC will behave the same way and the outcome of a dialog is always the same.\\n\\n- It is way too repetitive. Quests are always about: Killing life in any planet, with no reason at all; Delivering item X from A to B, with some generic space pirates in your way; Scan mineral/plants, again, with no reason at all, with no specification about it. The game must have twenty types of planets yet it quests are not really engaging enough; Destroy supply depots that have either a walker or some sentinels.\\n\\n- There is no ship customization. You will have to patiently watch random ships landing and taking off from a space station until find something you like. Races, sectors or planets have no influence about what you will find.\\n\\n- Inventory management is poorly made. Once you put your items from inventory to storage, you can\\'t get a fraction of it, you can split in packs, you either get all or none. That\\'s one of the basic principles of stacking items.\\n\\n- You can buy blueprints for new buildings and base parts with an item called \"salvaged data\", but if you follow one of the main quest lines you will have to build and hire specialists that will research most of the machines available to buy with salvaged data.\\n\\n- There is no automation at all. You explore a planet, but you have to manually check and refuel some machines that, for whatever reason, can\\'t be connected to your power grid.\\n\\nThey are still updating it and adding content that should have been released ages ago.

I would consider it in an early access state and definitely NOT worth $60! It still has so many issues. Some things have improved, but no much in my opinion. They added and changed a few things that help, but the same issues I dealt with before still exist. \\n\\nSo many things don\\'t work properly and the mission line needs some serious work. Mostly the advocates of this game focus on the \"infinite universe to explore\". Sounds neat, but after you visit a dozen or so planets you realize its just different combinations of the same 20 to 30 things. Planets and creatures mostly look and seem so similar that it becomes the same thing, over and over again. This has been tried to be hidden or distracted from by choosing different sounding names for the same things. All frozen planets are cold, snowy, icy places, but they can be called frost, frozen, glacier, freezing etc. Different names for the same thing. Its the same with all the planet types. Hot are called boiling or fiery or blazing. Toxic are called poisonous, or fungal etc. Every once in a while you might come across a planet or animal that surprises you, but not very often.  \\n\\nAside from the eventual boredom of the same things over and over again, there are a lot of issues with the set up of the missions. Specifically the order they force you to follow. For instance, the first thing you are required to build is a base computer which is under the portable menu, but once you establish your base, you can NEVER move it. Which means later, after you are able to build structures, you can\\'t put the stupid thing inside. Then, quite a long way down the road, after multiple missions doing other things, you are given an electromatic generator. Immediately finding out that the spot you chose for your base isn\\'t going to work because you aren\\'t on a hotspot, because you didn\\'t know about hotspots until now. So, you can either rely explicitly on solar power or move your entire base, start from scratch and rebuild. Solar power was frustrating for me as the panels don\\'t exactly indicate which direction they will face until after they are placed and you can\\'t pick them back up again. You end up being forced to move your base. The order of the missions should be different. A MOVEABLE base computer, followed by generators. Then, it should be exocraft third. Instead, you have mission after mission and upgrades and technology modules that require tons, literal tons of materials. Meaning you either have to hoof it all around the damn planet, or waste loads of fuel on your starship that only gets 4 lift offs flying from deposit to deposit. You don\\'t get the exocraft that is EXTREMELY helpful in traversing a planet on the ground and gathering materials until last. It is the last terminal you get which SUCKS! By then, you almost don\\'t need it! These are only a few of the problems I have found with the missions and their nonsensical order of progression.  There are tons more and they make game play extremely frustrating and unrewarding. You end up feeling cheated because you were forced to do things \"the hard way\" and grind like crazy only to find out that if things were just re ordered properly it would have made advancing a fun and rewarding experience. \\n\\nThen there are the CONSTANT bugs and weird things that happen. I have had knowledge stones suddenly morph into a crystal. Buildable recipes completely disappear, yet when I go to buy them, it says I already own them. Yet it won\\'t let me build them. Sometimes when I enter the build menu seemingly EVERY advanced item will be unlocked, I will even build some, then a minute later, none of them are available. This happens CONSTANTLY.\\nYou can\\'t walk through doorways, you have to jump. You can\\'t walk onto floors, you have to jump. Doors stay open when they are powered, making it impossible to put auto switches on them because they will close the door when you approach which is beyond stupid. \\nSometimes it doesn\\'t register that I am indoors even when I am and I have to refill my damn hazard charge or go sit in my ship to be safe from a storm. \\n\\nMultiplayer is all but useless. You can\\'t share the same storage. Can\\'t utilize the same base computer. It forces the other players that join your game to go build their own base to advance in their missions, which means you are just playing on your own anyway. The only benefit is that you can help others fight sentinels and pirates and you can trade items, but the whole thing is cumbersome and decidedly separate. \\n\\nBecause it will suddenly unlock items that shouldn\\'t be unlocked for you and then taking them away, it ends up corrupting your saves and the game gets CTD\\'S until you go in and clear certain files. It took several times, but I linked quite a few of these crashes to the game unlocking items that I shouldn\\'t have then taking them away. Other times I can\\'t figure out why it is crashing. \\n\\nI have also spent nanites on technology or recipes only to have them relocked after I save and quit. The next time I am on, all my nanites are still spent, but I have to re buy the damn things. It strangely seems to save only some things and not others. I found a crashed ship, claimed it, and got half of the things fixed on it. Only to log in the next day and it acted as if I had never claimed it. I had to re claim it and begin fixing it again. grinding for materials and jumping from solar system to solar system to look for parts or materials that I couldn\\'t build/find, only for it to do it again! I wasted nearly six hours and tons of materials trying to fix the damn ship 3 times before giving up. \\n\\nI will always hit the save point before exiting, and even though I return at the exact spot, a lot. A LOT of things I had done in the previous session won\\'t be there. Materials I gathered, certain items I made won\\'t be in my inventory. Machinery I built won\\'t be there etc. \\n\\nI have done everything I can on my end to make sure this stupid game runs smooth. I have all my drivers up to date, have verified files, uninstalled and reinstalled etc. This game is the issue. I have payed for over 100 hours and these things are CONSISTENT.\\n\\nNow, all that being said. It is still playable, as long as you can deal with the frustrations, but as I stated in the beginning, it is definitely in an early access state in my experience. It doesn\\'t run smooth, or feel fun. Its boring grinding and frustratingly repeating a lot of lost progress. Not to mention the rediculous cost of EVERYTHING. I haven\\'t even begun trying to earn enough to buy another ship, and frankly, I am just about burned out. I honestly don\\'t see how anyone can stick to playing this game continuously. \\n\\nI don\\'t recommend this. Wait another year or two and see if it improves. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"There may be some issues, but this is the closest to alien exploration you can get. Maybe some day they can improve their algorithm to make for more custom planets and changing the colors of your starship. The game can eventually get dull after a while, but the exploration makes the game fun. Fixing those issues might keep players around. \\n\\nChanging the description for aliens and plants would be great too. The algorithm just shoves random and repetitive blurbs together depending on the lifeform, so being able to personalize that more might make players more into the game and scanning things. As for minerals, many have the same properties, so maybe making them scan-able and re-nameable once would be good. Also letting players know how many types of minerals, flora and fauna are on a planet would be nice too, so they know when they've 100% a planet or moon. As well as having planets with 'super life' (i.e. planets with a large sum of lifeforms, something like 50 fauna and 100 flora, and massive creatures) would be pretty neat as well. Finding fauna is one of the most fun aspects of No Mans Sky, after all.\\n\\nThe addition of dwarf planets and even rouge planets would be neat. especially if the rouges were only in the system for X amount of time, and without a base they would be unreachable practically forever, as they are only passing through the system. You could have them in various states, depending on how long they were away from their home star for, or the content of their atmosphere. For example, dense nitrogen atmospheres hold in heat really well, allowing for liquid water on its surface. If the planet brought along a moon or two, the tidal pressure exerted would help distribute heat around the planet, keeping liquid water on its surface.\\n\\nMaking more reasons to return to old systems and bases would be great too. As it stands, once you leave a system why go back? And your base is practically gone. Maybe when setting up the base computer you could have an option to place a pre-existing base for X amount of materials (like one third to half worth the initial cost of the build) and then you could continue to add on and re-save that build, as well as have multiple builds saved at a time. When placing the base, you could go into builder mode automatically, and an outline shows up with little AI scanners going around, and you can more easily place the base were you'd like. Then you could get your materials and return to the hologram outline and press a key to add them until the materials have been met and the base is built. Connecting parts of a base together could be as simple as a connector mode in the building option, and much like hooking up electricity in the game, you'd connect parts of your build together to be saved as your base.\\n\\nThose are just a few of the ideas to improve this game that I've had while playing.

Stopped playing when they still had bugs in awakenings that caused npc's dialogue to break at the space station.\\n\\nThe biggest problems I think that plague it since the beginning is locking core gameplay mechanics behind required story missions in an open world environment. You basically have to do what the game wants you to do to unlock basic basebuilding features. It is an open world but you are punished in your capacity to create and use basic gameplay mechanics for not doing their fetch quest story missions. This in my opinion creates a lackluster linear experience. There's always creative I guess, for those that have no desire for any actual game content.

It is in a technical brilliant game and as a developer myself I can appreciate the proceedural generation work.\\n\\n The story is told through overly cryptic, short convo's without logical dialog branches.  Multiplayer only allows you to really be around your friends.  Very little reason to actually do anything in multiplayer.  Base building is ultimately pointless and unnecessary (all you need it for is processing higher tier ore and farming plants - which you can do elsewhere in the game).   \\n Base building especially around other people is buggy, putting another problem with actually doing this for multiplayer reasons.  \\n\\nAfter a while planets become very much the same thing arranged in different order.  Combat is not very challenging 90% of the time and you are almost never in any real danger (you don't have to defend your base).  \\n\\nYou can only have one frieghter in a system making multiplayer grouping silly.

No, because fuck you. Such a simple game design that they miss. And so using the scan for longer than 10 seconds (which you will do frequently) is annoying as hell.\\n\\nHow does a normal flightsim work? W&S are pitch (up/down), A&D are roll (think barrel roll), and Q&E are Yaw (think left/right in a tank). How does NMS work? You use your mouse to point where you want the plane to turn. It\\'s asinine. And it\\'d be one thing if that was the default and you could change to the normal pitch/roll/yaw. But you can\\'t, because fuck you.\\n\\nDo you like characters or plot? Think Destiny was bad? Well this makes Destiny feel like Firewatch or OG KOTOR. There\\'s this annoying \"learning alien words\" grind mechanic that just makes every NPC almost the exact same. Every space port: exact same with different name. And once you go to 5 or 10 planets, they\\'re all the same too. Do they have different names? Sure. But are they essentially the same? Yes. The procedural generation is this game is jut bad. And it FEELs worse.\\n\\nIf you want a good crafting/exploration game, go for Subnautica. Stay as far as you can away from NMS.',\n",

Of the planets I visited I found them to be 98% similar to others of their type. A radioactive planet is a radioactive planet. The plants will shift slightly, the creatures might have an extra wing. The potential wonder of an infinitely procedural universe is there, but in practice it seems dull and largely repetitive.\\nThe NPCs you encounter on any base seem like a software test from the early 90s. There's little to no reason to interact with them. There's a formulaic run through to learn a word, a tedious and unrewarding mechanic again.\\nSpace fights are dull beyond compare. I remember playing the original Wing Commander on PC with profound excitement. These feel like tech demos bolted onto the side. The enemy ships spin, fire, fly past. Your controls are designed for interplanetary navigation at a large scale.

I tried it several times, only paired with another player once for a brief quest to throw treats at a heard of animals. \\nThe nexus, which was designed to bring players together doesn't feel like a social space at all. The instanced multiplayer that is available doesn't seem to add anything of note from my experience.\\n\\nI enthusiastically explored it for the first 40 hours of gameplay, my interest and curiosity in the environment maintained its momentum for the most part.

Building, shooting, crafting, space combat, exploration etc.. unfortunatelly its just not enough of any of those and becomes repeatative fast. The world is indeed innormouse every planet is huge every system has 1-8 planets and there's pretty much an uncountable amount of systems.. however there's a couple of serious issues with that. first of all there's no biomes or rather very little biomes in the planets if you find a frozen planet its 90% frozen if you find a green one its 90% green. There's only a few types of biomes with very little difference between one lets say fiary planet to another and the generated structures on those planets are limited as well all adding up to exploring one planet is all the exploration your getting You can go and explore a new planet but your just gonna end up on a different shade of the same buildings and sites. The game has a crafting system which is unfortunatelly mostly used for making money and you need to go through an endless building hunt to unlock the recepies for that.. there's missions but they range between 5 different variations and after that its just more of the same. all and all. You can build your base which is really cool but the moment you join somebodies game the issues start... your base only half loads on their end.. they cant interact with most things.. the containers are personalised the terrain your demolished keeps regrowing inside the base (lets say you take down a tree to build a room.. well the tree just pops clipping through your entire struckture).

If you kill one even more will spawn at exactly your location. Yes survival should be harder, but not like this. Sentinels are dumb and not interesting. They just annoy you in every step of the way. Sentinel spawn rates, AI and how sentinels work should be completely reworked or even removed.\\n2. Space pirates. Same as with sentinels. Encounters are too frequent and uninteresting. Always the same. They are easy to run away from, easy to kill. 0 fun and gain in actually fighting them. Same as with sentinels the spawn rate and whole system maybe even space combat should be redone. So if space pirates attack you it would actually mean something, be different and fun to fight with them.\\n\\nRight now sentinels and pirates are just annoying vermins. Despite all bugs these two things are the actual fun killers of normal and especially survival game modes. I like survival mode and I do not mind a little more grinding to get things I want, but these two things are not the way survival should feel like.

Only exist when you use the warp feature to visit nearby systems. Very impressed by that. \\n\\n-You do feel a sense of exploration when playing this game. You can discover planets and rename each organism, mineral and plant to your own accord.\\n\\n-Has interesting mechanics like the language learning of different alien species. You can´t understand them at the beginning and have to learn their words to properly make out their speech. \\n\\n-Improved multiplayer capabilities. Now you can undergo missions with other players and take on tasks together. Very nice recent addition to the game. \\n\\n-Game offers different play style options for people. Some might play the game as a pure exploration game, some might have fun making money and crashing the economy of some systems and there is also base building for those who have fun creating structures on their own. \\n\\n\\n[b]The Negatives:[/b]\\n\\n-Terrain loading is horrible. Constant pop ins of animals or trees, Makes it hard to fly low on a planet when there is the danger of flying against a tree that suddenly appears in front of you. \\n\\n-Textures randomly don´t load correctly, causing npc´s and environments to use the low poly version, intended for far away objects to save on hardware resources. \\n\\n-Placement problems with buildings, regarding the freighter. Some rooms like the command room glitch out when trying to place, makes it nearly impossible to set it up without very precise placement on a specific spot. \\n\\n-Planets feel very similar to each other. Once you visited a handful of them, you know what to expect from the terrain generation. Looking at the 1.0 footage of the game shows more variety in planet generation, with more interesting structures than we currently have. I Propose an overwork of this feature, give the system more freedom and choices when generating a planet. \\n\\n\\n[b]Tldr:[/b] Nice and fun game about space with lots of various things to offer for the player, but it´s held back by the countless technical issues and bugs.

       " \"TL;DR Summary: An overly ambitious concept game from a team who clearly know how to dream, but not how to execute. As a result, the game remains in a permanent beta state that, as of now, just barely fulfills the promises made five years ago - once you get past all the bugs and quirks.\\n\\nDon’t let my play time fool you, those 294 hours are not an endorsement to the quality of the game, rather, they are a sad testament to my personal flavour of obsessive crazy, and the combined result of three separate instances of trying out this game. The first was launch day, where I had pre-ordered the game only to find it wouldn’t even run on my rig, despite my specs grossly exceeding the minimums – though that actually made me lucky, since it let me refund the launch price and then watch the overwhelmingly negative reviews roll in. The second was about 18 months ago, after one of the major updates, where I repurchased at a much lower price, messed around for a few hours, and quit out of boredom. It was only on the third try, after the BEYOND update and watching a friend stream some gameplay, that No Man’s Sky finally hooked me.\\n\\nLooking at this game’s spotty history it’s clear that Hello Games are a passionate group of artists who genuinely want to produce their vision, but I cannot help but imagine their development meetings being similar to two first-year college students, one a first year physics major and the other first year philosophy, both stoned out of their gourds with quality weed, discussing the universe and its purpose. A lot of crazy ideas, most of which only sound brilliant to them, and the few potential diamonds that come from their ramblings barely understood in the garbled memories and shorthand notes found the next day. They came up with an awesome idea, and presented it in a surprisingly dark and ominous setting. But the development is clearly scattered and on “valve time”, with priorities shifting from update to update and questionable focus (such as three times as many different types of craftable food than types of planets. I wish that was a joke). More than three years later, it’s still in an unpolished beta state, riddled with bugs and severely lacking in quality of life features, and with the clear understanding anything can be changed and corrupted with each update, even the core procedural generation that might just rewrite the entire universe. \\n\\nSo how did this mess hook me? The aforementioned setting. It’s not apparent right away, which is why I missed it on my second try, but as you progress past the initial survival scramble and start dipping your toe into the vast stellar ocean, a bunch of small things you notice soon snowball into a simple realization.\\n\\n[b]The universe is rotting.[/b]\\n\\nThere’s something fundamentally wrong about the state of the galaxy, and rotting is the best word I can think of to explain the feeling. This is not a (cosmic scale) young and growing universe like our own; the universe of No Man’s Sky is old, and under its sheen of being fully settled and populated, it is decaying, like some infection is slowly and irreversibly destroying it. And given how much of that decay is tied to logs and notes that are the only communication in a language you understand...[b]you might just be the one of the viruses[/b]. \\n\\nBecause you are alone. There’s three races that cohabitate all known areas of the galaxy – the [strike]Vulcans[/strike] Korvax, the [strike]Klingons[/strike] Vy’keen, and the [strike]Ferengi[/strike] Gek – but it seems not so much as that they have conquered the galaxy, as that they merely inhabit it, inheriting a network and technology and entire civilization that came before, and that for some reason has disappeared, leaving only artifacts and the omnipresent Sentinels to police the universe to their unwavering lawful neutral agenda. And in meeting those races, it is clear that you’re not one of them. Their languages are garbled to you, but they seem to treat you with respect that borders on fear. Only when you explore, wandering across planetary landscapes littered with discarded trash, broken machinery, and abandoned crash sites, will you eventually come across a language you understand. But that will bring you no comfort, for these words either come as creepypasta extracted from the slime covered computer of an infested and abandoned building, or from some ancient relic that predates the three races above, or from some freakish entity, glowing and ephemeral, speaking either of nonsense or of certain doom. Like them, you are an anomaly. \\n\\n[b]You are a Traveller.[/b]\\n\\nSo yeah, it hooked me.  But as said before, the actual mechanics of how this all works, of the gameplay that you go through to make the story progress from there, and that fulfils the original promise of “endless exploration in an infinite but shared universe” falls flat. It is incredibly grindy, repetitive, poorly optimised, and full of stupid bugs that even the most basic quality assurance procedures should catch. All the reviews seem to quote “wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle”, and I’ll repeat it since it’s 100% correct. There are only 9 planet templates – which, if you’re generous grows to 15 if you count “with oceans” and “without oceans” as different, but I don’t – and only the rarest two of those templates have any meaningful subtypes. The challenge curve is negative, because the universe is so generic that nothing changes with your travels aside from you personally growing stronger with upgrades to your suit, weapon, and ship. And those upgrades take forever, as the increments of improvement are often so minor, or only available at the whim of RNGeezus. So you just keep going to the same places, and doing the same things, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and it gets mindlessly easier every time. By the time I reached the centre, I had to travel through 297 systems, and since I [strike]wanted[/strike] obsessively felt I had to “tag” every planet, that meant I landed on and at least nominally explored (as in, stood in one place and scanned everything I could see) 588 planets – so yes, I cherry-picked systems that only had one or two planets whenever I could.\\n\\nAnd then, after 294 hours of that and finally reaching the centre, you apparently stop and write a negative review. Because, like I said, personal flavour of obsessive crazy. To hammer home the point, I was going to end with just a laundry list of stuff that annoyed me, and kept the game from ever being fun, rather than something I just felt I had to finish.  Which would have been fitting, because just like this review wouldn't have had a proper end, neither does the game. This list was as of the BEYOND update, and is scattered, incomplete, and only loosely organized. Again, like the game itself. \\n\\nBut it's so long, it would make the review exceed the word count.

It worked with the Xbox 360 controller only.  Personally, I do not enjoy using a gamepad or mouse to 'fly' a space ship.  So I used x360ce to emulate the Xbox360 controller.  And then I used my Logitech or Thrustmaster to control the ship.\\n\\nBut then along came the BEYOND update.  And Hello Games made the decision to integrate with Steam BIg Picture.  That bricked x360ce, and so the game is back to just supporting a mouse or a gamepad.  Oh, sure, you can map a generic controller in Steam Big Picture.  But the problem is, to map a generic controller as a 360 or steam controller, it has to have at least as many buttons as the one you're emulating.  Therefore, neither my joystick nor HOTAS will work anymore.\\n\\nFor this reason I can't recommend this game.\\n\\nIf you find a workaround, then great!  The core game is fun.  There is plenty to do (despite some reviews.)\",\n",

It’s an interesting game. \\n\\nTLDR: Awesome exploration game. Riddled with game breaking bugs that have been around for years. HG still hasn’t taken necessary steps to fix them, rather they’re worried about providing VR to 1% of the players.\\n\\n [h1] Pros  [/h1]\\n1. Great looking game.\\n \\n2. Awesome exploration concept. Who doesn’t like being able to travel from solar system to solar system exploring multiple galaxies?\\n\\n3. I love the building/crafting in this game. I love grindy games. Don’t get it wrong either. This is about as grindy as you can get. \\n\\n [h1] Cons  [/h1]\\n1. Bugs galore. Hello Games is TERRIBLE at correcting bugs. There’re bugs that’ve been around since the inception. Some are quite game braking. Countless times I’ll be doing a main story quest, just to have it stop working. When that happens, there are only two things you can do. Keep grinding out mats, and pray to Jesus that it un-f*cks itself and starts working. Or kiss your 90 hour save goodbye, and start all over. No idea why this isn’t a to priority for HG. \\n\\n2. Materials are still disappearing from harvesters, refiners, mining units etc. nobody likes wasting time.\\n\\n3. The terrain still “grows” back. Meaning that after you level off a nice area and build your base. The next time you log in, prepare to have your base filled in with sediment. What makes it even better is, you can’t use your terrain tool to clear it out most of the time. Because you can’t use the terrain gun while in a habitat. So, you must destroy your base, and rebuild. \\n\\n [h1] Conclusion  [/h1] \\nI’ve spent more time trying to work around game bugs than playing the game. Either by going back and forth a hundred times trying to get a mission to properly start, or constantly saving the game, shutting it down and trying to edit the save files so that I can get some sort of progression.

I write this as a warning, in my first like 50 hours none of it was a big issue, but it became a growing pain.\\n\\n- Base building: If you build a base, don\\'t even bother removing or editing terrain and beware building it inside a mountain. All terrain will grow back and overgrow your base, including facilities, landing platforms, doors etc. Plants and rocks will regrow through the floors even.\\n\\n- Bases on Freighters: A mobile base, how cool is that. However, only if you NEVER move your freighter you should try this. I built couple hours on the interior, storages, plants, rooms, neat decorations, even a manual saving point because, ya know, saving is everything after all this work. Few hours later I warped my freighter to my home base, thinking about nothing bad and *poof* each and every single customization was gone. Completely. Reset to zero and of course not even giving me back materials. I mean, really???\\n\\n- Explorations: The game is all about exploring randomly generated star systems. You can literally name everything, every planet, every plant, every animal, make it yours. Sounds great, huh? Only that after a couple planets it all gets - likely - overwritten by your newer discoveries. How hard it is to SAVE customizations and explorations in the cloud and provide them when I revisit a planet? Yes, you can re-explore and re-scan everything on the older planets you discovered and eventually the old names (if they were uploaded to the server before) show again.\\nBut this is not what makes you feel like progressing. Even space stations you visit reset completely after a while, as if you never talked to anyone there. What are bazillion planets for if you don\\'t really need to move; you can stay where you are and rediscover old stuff over and over again since the game forgets you were there, all the time. Hardly anything gets saved.\\n\\nThere\\'s a hell lot of other bugs like facilities not working, false info, storages not accessible at times, modules not building, multiplayer issues (the game is single player, originally, and it shows everywhere) etc. However, I don\\'t mind all these. Save my customizations, buildings and explorations already and I\\'d be happily recommending the game, wholeheartedly.\\n\\nAlso despite infinite planets the game got a definite ending point where you got the feeling to have it played \"through\". After doing all quests you only can do the ever-same 3 dailies, one more daily task for Quicksilver or randomly explore planets which are no longer really surprising, though. Once you know the main \"types\" this is all pretty repetitive.\\nIt\\'s nice to come back now and then, also I stayed much longer than friends, but it simply won\\'t tie you up as much (or at all) anymore, once there\\'s no longer real goals to pursue.\\n',\n",

       " 'I\\'ve heard so many mixed reviews about NO MAN\\'S SKY that made me wonder what all the fuzz was about. On the surface the game seems to be something I might enjoy, combining exploration on a vast scale, building, crafting and handsome looking graphics. The asking price of $60 promises a AAA title, so when it was on sale the other day, both on Steam and on GOG, I picked it up and had a look at it.\\n\\nI\\'m coming into this game cold, not knowing what to expect. I literally had no expectations, other than the hope of having a good time. Sadly that didn\\'t happen. It can be like that with complex games though, you have to give it an hour or two to get into them, learn the interface, understand what you\\'re supposed to do. Good games (like any good software) will help you make this a welcoming experience. \\n\\nNO MAN\\'S SKY doesn\\'t do that. It\\'s not even trying. \\n\\nThe premise of the game is that we\\'ve lost our memory, crash landed on a planet, our space ship is broken, life support in our suit is failing, and we have to find  way to survive (not necessarily in that order). We need to fix that multi tool, hunt for resources, build some spare parts and get off this rock. Where have I heard that story before?\\n\\nWhat usually happens is that you\\'re given a quick tutorial as to what buttons to press and how to do things. Like a brief tutorial, even if it\\'s disguised as a mission of sorts. NO MAN\\'S SKY doesn\\'t do that. Instead you\\'re left to figure out an overly complex, unintuitive, badly designed interface all by yourself. No matter what buttons I pressed, it was not obvious to me how to navigate around. I was playing with a game controller, and while it is fully supported and recognised, the mapping and navigation wasn\\'t really made for it - nor did they try very hard getting to get it right. Bizarre concept for a console release.\\n\\nEventually I figured out the basics, after what feels like half an hour, and it certainly wasn\\'t fun getting to that point. The next thing the game does is send you far away to a distant point in the desolate landscape, to retrieve some vital part necessary for fixing my ship. To get there we have to walk 20 minutes through a wasteland that is the procedurally generated planet. We meet some procedural animals, plants, marvel at the day/night cycle and the ever changing light effects, all the while making sure we don\\'t die of heat exposure. Nothing else happens. For 20 minutes of my life. \\n\\nWhen we finally retrieve that \"thing\" we need, we walk back to our ship, through the same landscape we\\'ve already seen, for yet another 20 minutes. We may encounter a structure to explore on the way, but it becomes painfully obvious that perhaps a car or some other form of transportation would come in handy. Maybe at some point we\\'ll find out how to build one, but it doesn\\'t help us right now - having just wasted 40 minutes of our lives doing nothing other than push that left thumb stick forward, or hold down the W key. We finally get back to the ship, put that part in, only to find out that we now have to find some resources to progress. We walk around, we scan things, we use that laster thing to harvest things, and that about wraps it up for my two hour test of the game.\\n\\nSo what just happened? Am I hooked on NO MAN\\'S SKY? Am I eager to see where this is going? What other worlds and wonders lie ahead? How am I feeling? Is this the beginning of an exciting journey, an intriguing story that I can\\'t wait to see unfold?\\n\\nActually no. I\\'m frustrated, disappointed, bored to death with this game. The feeling of having been ripped off seeps in, so much so that I take a look at Steam\\'s refund policy. It\\'s that bad!\\nI truly appreciate what Hello Games have tried to implement here: a fully procedural universe with (probably) tons of features, lush underwater worlds, vehicles and buildings I could build, uncover intriguing mysteries - but it seems that I\\'m destined never to see any of that. Had it not been for the various launch and update trailers, I would have no idea those things even exist in the game.\\n\\nSo I give NO MAN\\'S SKY the benefit of the doubt and start a new game, this time in creative mode. That\\'s the one where we don\\'t have to worry about survival or resource hunting. We can just start building things and see if that\\'s more welcoming. I know it greatly helped me get the hang of Subnautica. But that logic doesn\\'t hold true here: the interface is so unintuitive that it\\'s impossible for me to work out how to build anything.\\n\\nThe final  thing I\\'ve tried was to leave the planet, and see what another procedurally generated world might look like. Be dazzled by that no-loading-screen take-off and landing sequence I\\'ve heard so much about. So I jump into my (magically no longer damaged) space ship, exploring the cockpit, and... nothing. All I can do is get in and out. There are no controls, no buttons, no explanations, no nothing. Are they serious? Nobody noticed these fatal design flaws during play testing?\\nPuzzled and confused, I go back into my previous game. There has to be more to NO MAN\\'S SKY than this. I spend another hour walking around, trying really hard to like this game. Knowing full well that \"this\" can\\'t be everything. There has to be something here that hooks the player\\'s attention before they hit \"uninstall\". But no matter what I do, all I feel at this point is that this game isn\\'t for me. Perhaps it\\'s totally obvious what players have to do, and maybe I\\'m just too stupid or too old - or maybe I\\'m just painfully aware that our time on THIS planet (Earth) is way too short to waste it on badly designed prototypes like NO MAN\\'S SKY. \\n\\nI really appreciate that the team have been sticking this one out. I love that three years after it\\'s original (flawed) release in 2016, they\\'re bringing out major upgrades in this game for free. They\\'re tirelessly working on their original vision, they\\'ve been under huge scrutiny for years, and they\\'re still in business. They haven\\'t given up, and I give them 10 out of 10 stars for hanging in there. \\n\\nI feel reminded of Mass Effect Andromeda, whose team knew early on that they\\'ve built a lemon, and very quickly abandoned the project after release. Fix what you can, then cut your losses and move on. That\\'s what most humans would do, especially if there\\'s finance people involved. But Hello Games didn\\'t do that. They believed in NO MAN\\'S SKY, and they continue to believe in it. Besides, the graphics are beautiful. Photo Mode is extremely well implemented and a lot of fun to play with. We can take beautiful shots with this game in real time. The character animations are nice, the sound design is great, and I really get a feeling of abandoned loneliness on that one planet I was able to explore. I can imagine that had I gotten into it, this could have been a great long journey and an enjoyable experience for me, and my viewers alike.\\n\\nWhich is why is pains me to say that, without any discernible story, a terribly designed interface, and the complete non-starter experience I\\'ve made, I\\'m now so bored with the game that I can only abandon it and move on. Sorry team, it\\'s not for me. How many hours do you expect me to give you? Five? Ten? Twenty? Imagine investing that much time into a game and not getting anything in return? \\n\\nIf a game has \"mixed\" reviews, it means there aren\\'t just a couple of nut jobs out there who dislike it. It means you\\'ve not got the basics right. You\\'ve been focussing on things players are likely never to experience, and you\\'ve missed out on showing players what awaits them, or how to get there.\\n\\nRest in peace, NO MAN\\'S SKY.',\n",

I pre ordered this game and played in the very first day of launch, it was clunky, REALLY bad optimized, buggy and ugly... But for some reason, the feeling of exploring, the feeling of freedom and getting out of the atmosphere to reach space and see how small you are compared to the universe, it was magic and i kept playing no man\\'s sky for many hours.\\nAlthough games are, to some extent, forms of art as George R.R Martin himself said \"Games are almost art, they\\'re getting there\" they still need some specific aspects to be considered such. These aspects relate to visuals, experience, story etc. No man\\'s sky sure has visuals, they\\'re gorgeous when you\\'re out there in space as i said, the first contact with exploring the universe was magnificent. But that\\'s it, i felt like there was always something holding me from enjoying the game in a \"contemplative\" aspect or in a exploration aspect (must be because you need to refuel your suit every 30 seconds and you can only use your landing pads 4 times before you need to refuel them again, kinda breaking the cool part of the game and being a ship pilot going wherever the fuck i want+ the sentinels are a pain in the ass and not a challenge). But then they implemented a \"creative mode\" and still i couldn\\'t immerse myself in the space adventure for some reason, it felt just superficial again. The repetitive places and gameplay aspects that were just annoying were not enough to keep me playing for endless hours.\\nBut hey, there\\'s the OTHER side of this game that is less artistic and more practical. You grind (simple as that) and i feel like all i did was to try to find a decent system with a decent RNG and start mining or crafting stuff to sell. Don\\'t get me wrong i love grinding in some games, but here\\'s the catch: you grind because you want a nice reward; or let\\'s go deeper and say that you play games because you want to feel rewarded (that\\'s why rpg games are so addictive). In all my gameplay, didn\\'t feel rewarded at all, you can disagree and say that i played it the wrong way but that\\'s the truth, the sense of reward is way too low to become addictive and making me want to play again\\ni can\\'t recommend this game, but if you REALLY LOVE space exploration, space minecraft, RNG clusterfuck and you don\\'t really care about a low sense of reward... Give it a try, you might like it. \\nIf you want a space adventure with fair challenge, depth, high sense of reward and perhaps some cool grinding then you might need to wait for such a game to come out. \\nSorry for the long text\\nHello Games don\\'t give up, You\\'re in the right way.

It\\'s not HARD because all the enemies die pretty quickly as long as you can manage to shoot them enough times, or if you\\'ve got some backup from your freighters, but it\\'s no fun and it feels like a chore.\\n\\nThere\\'s trading to be done, but that too doesn\\'t feel like it belongs in this game, especially when you buy something and find out you have to carry it in stacks of 5 and so you can only hold 40 of them because you don\\'t have enough slots left. I should be able to fill a cargo ship with whatever I want (within reason) and sell it without worrying about hearing the dreaded \"[i]NO FREE SLOTS IN SUIT IN-VEN-TREE[/i]\".   \\n\\nI heard enough of that in the first 30 minutes of playing the game.  Highly annoying and reminiscent of those games where they fill your pockets with trash as an obstacle...mostly because they do.  Several chests you find have \"rusted metal\" that you have to put in your pockets (or ship, or exocraft, or freighter, but you MUST TAKE IT before you can throw it away) and sometimes after taking the crap metal I have to stop, throw it away and then open the chest again to get to the REAL contents.  That is not fun.  That\\'s annoying as hell. \\n\\nThen we have the story in this game.  You have to find out the lore in bits and pieces through various terminals and oracles and shrines, and talking to people and so on, and that\\'s fine I guess, but the story itself isn\\'t exactly riveting.  There\\'s actual missions you can take that advance parts of the story more directly and that\\'s not exactly riveting either.  I\\'d give the Story 3/5.  It\\'s passable at best...and that\\'s when the game works properly.\\n\\nWhile we\\'re talking about that, this game crashed a lot on me, or if it doesn\\'t crash, stuff just doesn\\'t work right.  Or if it works right, it\\'ll stop working right later for no reason.  As an example, after a long game session, I\\'ll open one of the giant inventory boxes they make you put up so you can store more junk, and I\\'ll have plenty of space for something but I\\'ll click on the item and it\\'ll tell me \"INVENTORY FULL\" in that robo-voice, and I had no idea why... but I found out.  Somehow two items get stuck into one slot but it only shows the top item.   \\n\\nExample:  I see Phosphorous in the storage, so I click on it and it tells me I can\\'t take it... I clear out as much room as possible and try to take something else, which works just fine, but then I go back for the phosphorous and lo and behold, something else jumps into the now-free slot (maybe ferrite dust? Maybe something else) and I\\'ll be thinking \"where did that stuff come from?\"  Apparently out of the 5 slots they give you per storage unit, sometimes 6 items get shoved in there and then you can\\'t take from it until room is made for the 6th item to pop out. Weird.\\n\\nThere\\'s also numerous times when quests will just screw up on me.  It\\'ll tell me to see someone to start a quest, and then upon starting it, it\\'ll immediately tell me I am done even though I did nothing and did NOT fulfill the quest at all.  Then it might hang up and not allow me to progress any further or it might just skip over something crucial and leave me wondering why everything is broken now?  There\\'s an option somewhere to restart some of these quests but it really is annoying and doesn\\'t seem to work for all quests.\\n\\nSo I can see you\\'re reading all of this and thinking \"Why the hell did you even buy this game?\"  Well, honestly, I bought it for the VR support.   This game didn\\'t interest me at all until VR and that\\'s where I started playing it and started to really enjoy the exploration aspect.  I actually spent like 6 hours in VR at a time JUST in this game, but they were pretty frustrating hours... mostly because some of the controls in VR are even worse than they are in the pancake version, but also because some stuff just flat out doesn\\'t work in VR.   \\n\\nExample: I can\\'t rename anything in VR... for a long time one of the multi-tool weapons didn\\'t work in VR (I think they fixed that now), flying a ship in VR is made more frustrating by the fact that your hands can get \"glued\" to the stick and you want to move your hand away for some reason but instead you wind up pulling hard on the stick.  I think I had to squeeze the grip again to get it to quit.  Other times I\\'m able to disengage by just moving my hand far enough away, but flying in VR is even less fun than flying on the pancake version and that\\'s really a shame.  \\n\\nSo a quick rundown for those who don\\'t want to read all of that:\\n+ Planet exploration is great (at first at least)\\n- Space exploration sucks \\n+ learning the lore and language is neat but kinda tedious (so it\\'s a bit of a negative after a while)\\n- Quests screw up all the time and if you can\\'t restart it then it may just break everything.  \\n- combat sucks in almost every form but mostly space combat....The terrestrial stuff at least sorta feels like a FPS.\\n+ VR is super neat and the best reason to own this game\\n- VR is/was/probably will always be kinda buggy and more trouble than it\\'s worth on lots of different aspects of the game\\n+ Lots of story to play through\\n- But the story isn\\'t that interesting.  You may like it but I think I spotted the \"twist\" a long time ago and it\\'s not that new or original...but keep in mind that I never finished it because ultimately (original or not) I found it rather boring.  Again, you may like it.\\n\\nThis review is a mess....but that\\'s somewhat fitting for this game which is also a hot mess.  I feel like they started off with a grand concept that was unfinished (which bit them in the ass when everyone found out), then they added on to it in ways that helped to flesh it out but don\\'t feel like they were entirely planned, or not well planned anyway.  Now years later, the game is bigger and better than it was, but the code is probably a big spaghetti tangle and pulling one thread to unravel a bug knots 3 more in its wake.\\n\\nIf you have a lot of free time and patience and you don\\'t mind a sub-par story, but you love base building, and playing online with friends, this might still be worth it for you, but it\\'s not for me.  Sorry folks',\n",

I understand for some they game has been fixed, and we all know when this update came out it REALLY screwed the game up. \\nHowever on my end and my friends ends, the game is literally unplayable. I cant even begin to go into details on what is wrong but i can simplify it to constant falling through stations, crashes, poor performance, constant glitches and bugs, ETC. I dont mind the game getting updated and wiping my save everytime, i dont mind the fact its still being developed and will have some issues. I dont mind when my game crashes from time to time. I do mind where its at the point where i literally cannot play the game anymore.\\nI dont suggest this game for that reason alone that you could be one of the people who buy this, boot it up, and realize your game is also broken and it cannot be played.

How long will they make me fly in a straight line this time before I am plunged into the next warp screen opening a canvas to the next breathtaking barren world filled with colossal amounts of empty space? What color will the wasteland be this time? Will I finally stumble across the purple watered, blue landed paradise filled with flying spiders and giraffe rabbits? How many dozens of warp screens will I watch before the time I spent watching them equals the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy and all of the special features? Its questions like these that make me feel like the heroic explorers of the past and allow me to ponder of the infinite possibilities of what I could have done with all the time spent watching those numerous warp screens.\\n\\nI loved walking slowly to my ship and flying through a warp load screen off planet then flying into a space station with a docking cut scene while I slowly walked to the teleporter in the space station for a warp load screen in space to get to my space base to stash supplies very slowly into my extremely limited inventory space so that I could slowly walk back to the teleporter on my space base and warp load screen back to the space station to sell slowly sell off my very limited inventory space for space units in a space merchant system designed by the same psychotic people who patented robot telemarketing and the space between your car seat and center console big enough for change and phones to fall into, but not big enough for a hand to fit into.\\n\\n Afterwards I fondly remember slowly teleporting from station to station to station, always greeted by the familiar comfort of the LSD infused warp screen, to go from one stereotype alien to the next and dredge through their merchant page to slowly spend my space units on upgrades, weapons, and the materials needed to explore deeper into this vast world of loading screens. \\n\\nMy pupils involuntarily dilate at the thought of continuing the adventure of exploring the planets ranging from any of the colors from the 64 color box of Crayola crayons and exploiting them for resources.

I loved how the developers really made an effort to make the player sit through warp screens at every possible occasion to give you time to make you wonder things like: \"what am I doing with my life?\" \"Why am I doing this?\" \"why do I exist?\" \"what does it all mean?\" \\n\\nIf I could go back in time, to a time before I played No Man\\'s Sky, I would probably die instantly from having to watch 1 more space loading screen from going back in time. \\n\\nDon\\'t ever play this game.',\n",

       " \"(note: I do not play multiplayer, nor do I play in VR)\\n\\nNo Man's Sky tries to do everything, but is shallow in every aspect. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE.\\n\\nExploration: The first several planets are interesting with weird animals and plants. After visiting a dozen planets, you'll find that they are mostly the same. All radioactive planets have the same aesthetics; all frozen planets have he same kind of trees; all toxic planets are inhabited by the same type of flora. And because there are only several type of planets, you'll find this 'sameness' show up very quickly. The type of fauna is quite limited as well. After five to ten planets, you'll see animals repeat over and over. For a game supposedly about exploring an 'infinite' universe, it's a huge weakness. And there's a thing that grates me and a lot of people: plants and animals pop in right in front of you, appearing out of thin air and instantly ending your suspension of disbelief. It somehow got far worse in the newest update.\\n\\nCreature interaction: You can ride creatures or gain their food products after feeding them. The novelty will fade off pretty quickly. You can't keep them as pets; they'll despawn if you move far away from them.\\n\\nResource management: It only serves to interfere with the 'exploration' aspect of the game. Gathering resources involves standing there shooting a beam at rocks and plants, which is boring as heck. Why do you need to gather resources in an 'exploration' game? Because you'll need them to recharge your hazard protection unit, life support, starship engine and warping system. It's not a challenge; you become kind of immortal after 10 minutes of gameplay (unless you are careless of course). But it forces you to constantly pause your exploration and fiddle with those sodium, oxygen, di-hydrogen, etc.\\n\\nInventory management: The most important gameplay loop of No Man's Sky is not exploring planets; it's expanding the inventory of your exosuit to reduce the tedium of resource management. But it is itself tedious. You expand your inventory by visiting space stations and ground based 'drop pods'. The former can only be used once per star system, forcing you to warp to a lot of systems; the latter requires an expensive item to even be found, after which asks you to gather a lot of resources before being usable. And you'll need to do this tedious task EIGHTY-THREE times before having a full inventory!\\n\\nStarships: They are functionally the same. They may look different but even your starting ship can do everything a high level ship can do (space combat, flying from to planets, from system to system, etc. ). The only difference is the number of inventory slots.\\n\\nSentient Aliens: They inhabit the whole universe for some untold reason; their buildings scatter around almost every planet, but cities are weirdly absent. There are three cliched races: traders, explorers and warriors, which you see in every sci-fi work. They supposedly have a rich and turbulent history, but your interactions with them do not reflect this, save for some cliched lore text dump.\\n\\nCombat: You fight two types of enemies: ground based sentinels and space pirates. They're basically about who has higher DPS. There is no nuanced strategy. You stand there (or sit in your spaceship) and shoot at the enemies until they die.\\n\\nBase building: It's acceptable, but nowhere as good as in Minecraft. To access base parts you need hundreds of 'salvaged data' which are scattered around surfaces of planets and take up dozens of hours to gather, before you can do anything meaningful in construction. The customization possibility is low because you only use prefabs, not blocks like in Minecraft.\\nThey recently introduced a power system. Again, it's rudimentary, far worst than the Minecraft redstone system. A big functioning base require a huge amounts of solar panels, which interferes with the aesthetics of big bases. \\n\\nFreighters and frigates: You can build a mobile base on your own freighter, but it's as shallow as ground-based base building. You can send out frigates to do missions, but the planning you do is absolutely minimal. You can't decide which star system to go, which planet to explore. It's as exciting as watching paint dry.\\n\\nStory missions: Completely lack depth. You go somewhere, interact with someone while looking at some text lore, do something (like gathering x amount of resources or killing x enemies) at their request, and report back to them. The presentation and content is so bad that I do not care about the protagonists at all.\\n\\nCooking: The newest update introduced cooking, which is fine. But what do you do with those finished foods? You either eat them to recharge your life support or give them to an NPC for some currency. You can't even put them as items into your own base!\\n\\nAnd last but not least: Bugs and performance!\\nOh man, the bugs in this game are numerous and never-ending. The developers seem to have a talent of introducing bugs with every major update. The performance of the game is absolutely horrendous.\\nYou can clip through freighters making you suspended in outer space, forcing you to reload.\\nFeeding creatures can crash the game.\\nFPS drop to 10-15 in small bases; it gets even lower in large bases.\\n\\nOnce again, do not buy this shallow game. You'll regret it.\\nIf you want a survival/crafting game, get Subnautica.\\nIf you want a game about construction and creativity, get Minecraft.\\nIf you want a game about exploration, combat and story, get the Witcher III.\\nDO NOT BUY NO MAN'S SKY.\",\n",

Underwater base building is fun for a moment until you realize that every ocean on every planet is quite shallow and the same. \\n\\nThe Nexus part of Beyond showed promise of a more interesting multiplayer, but did not truly add anything significant. Playing with friends remains just building bases or flying near each other with very little interaction. \\n\\nOverall I wont deny that they have built a massive array of galaxies, fauna, and flora but the novelty wears thin quickly.

I'm no stranger to games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 that can become borderline unplayable very rapidly but without any mods NMS might drop you through a fake floor, send you flying into space, delete items you spent hours crafting, or even forget your entire base. That kind of instability could have been excusable for the first year, but it's three years later and I'm getting bugs that I could have sworn were solved years ago.\\n\\nEven if you can get past the general atmosphere of instability, VR is so disappointing. Not that it's inherently bad, but that it could be so much better. Loading up the game in VR might make your controllers disappear, button prompts vanish, or nothing might happen at all as HG didn't set default controls.

Also as mentioned above there are many bugs that make the experience very frustrating.\\n\\n\\n30 hours in - Find out there isnt really any real challenge its just about grinding and progressively getting more material to get better equipment so you guessed it. You can grind for even more.\\n\\n40 hours in - Repeat of the previous but finally bored of it and realise nothing is actually coming from the grinding may aswell waste my time doing it on an mmo as at least can do that with friends. There is multiplayer on no mans sky but its basically like youre both playing your own single player game and doing very little together as you can\\'t build bases together or use each others ships and most quests are done solo.\\n\\nThe most unique thing I found in this game is that sh*t is called faecium and is an element you can sellwhich I found amusing. Without spoiling the ending to the game (which is the main reason I stopped after a friend told me and I lookedi nto it to confirm)\\nWill likely make you think its the most retarded ending to a game youve ever known as without spoling it undoes alot of your hard work so you can you\\'ve guessed it grind even more.\\n\\nI rate this 3 out of 10 faecium',\n",

There\\'s no part in this game what can be considered any kind of \\'good\\'. \\n\\n[h1]It\\'s poorly done.[/h1]\\nIt have a hint of three billion different gameplay mechanics, and none of them is developed to any sorts of depth. They just stays as a hints. Like you playing early alpha or something. And that\\'s after few major updates!\\n\\n[h1]The Universe[/h1]\\nIt promises endless universe with billions of solar systems... But they all the same. After you visit 10 or so planets - you\\'ll get bored. There would be hills with randomly scattered mineral nodes and tries. \\n\\n[h1]Planetary exploration[/h1]\\nEvery planet have exactly ONE biome. From pole to equator and back to pole again - every planet would look exactly the same as the place where you first landed. And there is less then 10 noticeably distinct types of planets.\\nOn most of the planets - there\\'s buildings. And, as you might have guess, there\\'s about 10-15 distinct planetary structures. Throughout whole universe, yes, not just the planet. All of them - standalone structures, just scattered randomly. No cities, no infrastructure - just random buildings in the middle of the great nowhere. Almost all planets have almost all types of structures on them.\\n\\n[h1]Ground Combat[/h1]\\nIs... boring. On every planet there\\'s Sentinels. 4 types of them. Yes, 4 types throughout the endless Universe. It\\'s a Drone, Armored Drone, Doggo and a Walker. They come in waves and after you defeat  one wave, in a less then a minute game will spawn next, stronger wave. After you defeat strongest wave... it will spawn it again. Ad infinitum. And yeah, \"strongest\" means two armored drones, two doggos and a walker. After you get hang of it, defeating them is not a really big deal. Just annoying. When you tired of fighting you could always jump into your spaceship and zip away. There would be no consequences. Oh you could hide in the burrow, they will search you for a minute and then forgot what you ever existed.\\nThere\\'s also Zerg-like creatures, what pose a bit of threat, but you could notice their nest from a mile and they never attack unprovoked. Yeah.\\nAnd even if you die... You\\'ll be respawned at your starship, which is probably parked fifty to two hundred meters away. Because the\\'s no any sensible way to get to that location without your spaceship in the first place. That\\'s HARDCORE, man.\\n\\n[h1]Space Combat[/h1]\\nEven more boring. And more annoying, because here you\\'ll get attacked from time to time and could not escape before killing everyone. Also, you could recharge your shield for resources and for kills, and your opponent does not have any shields at all. I never died in space. Your HUD is also super useless, so you fight in 3D almost blind. But more on that later.\\n\\n[h1]Resources[/h1]\\nThere\\'s gazillion different resources, and most of them - useless. They exist just craft one or two things which you probably never ever would craft in the first place. because they are also useless. It would\\'t be such a big issue, but you have extremely limited inventory space. And you have no way of telling, which resources are essential and which is just a garbage. Because it\\'s so inconsistent.\\n\\n[h1]Chemistry[/h1]\\nAt first it just leave bad taste in my mouth but then then it became epiphany. It\\'s just describes whole game/ It\\'s so inconsistent, it makes your brain hurt, it\\'s dead wrong and it\\'s weird.\\nFirst of all, it\\'s called \\'refining\\'. And it starts as a quite promising feature, but goes sour really fast.\\nYou have qute a few elements. Things like Oxygen, Nitrogen, Radon, Cobalt, Carbon, Tritium... Each one of them have a corresponding symbol from periodic table. GOOD. But most corresponding resource icons have some variation of generic pop-culture image of an atom, from the guy, who never had a chemistry class in his life. Just bad attention to details, you say. It is. But it gets worse.\\n\\nIron called \"Ferrite\". Why? \\n\\nHydrogen called Di-hydrogen. Why?! Why there isn\\'t things like di-oxygen, di-nitrogen then? All those gases prefer to exist in di-form. Which means what they are naturally forms molecules like H2, O2 and N2, correspondingly. Also, this di-hydrogen have an icon what better suited for deuterium. But they have deuterium. And it have an icon of two di-hydrogen \\'thingies\\'. AAAAAH! Awesome level of scientific literacy for Sci-Fi game. Yet the Tritium have an icon which is acceptable for Tritium. Consistency!\\n\\nCarbon Dioxide called Dioxite. What. Yes. This word does\\'t even exist, and they have lots of fictional compounds, but they choose to slap CO2 formula on it. WHY?!\\n\\nBut it\\'s get worse.\\n\\nBecause there\\'s...\\n\\n[h1]Refining[/h1]\\nIt called refining, but in fact it\\'s transmutations. Things are completely unpredictable there. It follows no logic, it makes no sense.\\n\\nOkay, you get Ferrite, you combine it with Oxygen, and you get... Rusted Metal. Fair enough.\\nNow, equipped with this knowledge you take Oxygen, combine it with Hydrogen and you get... Yeah, you guessed it, Sodium Chloride. You still with me? Breathe.\\nOkay, now it\\'s a bit easier. \\nYou could refine Sodium Chloride into Chlorine gas. Fine. Sodium is much more valuable resource in the game, but okay.\\nBut now you could combine Chlorine with Oxygen. And no, there\\'s no chlorine oxides in the game, thankfully.\\nFor one unit of Chlorine and two units of Oxygen you\\'ll get... bear with me... six units of Chlorine. Yes. You quite literally creating things from thin air here.\\nAnt everything is like that. You need carbon nanotubes to make microprocessors. WHY?! What carbon ever have to do with microprocessors? \\nTo make Circuit Board you need bunch of fruits what you could reliably get in desired quantities only from really extensive farming.\\nJust... NO. God. Ugh.\\n\\n[h1]Interface and Navigation[/h1]\\nI could continue on, and on, and on. Every, and i mean it, EVERY gameplay mechanic there ether broken or so shallow and undeveloped, it have no right to be in a finished product. But i guess I said more then enough already.\\nBut this thing have to be addressed.\\nThe interface in the game there just to annoy hell out of you.\\nThere is no map.\\nThere is no planetary maps.\\nThere is no solar system maps.\\nThere is no galaxy map. Last one not exactly true, but call this assortment of random nondescript dots a map is also a bit of stretch.\\nNavball in your starship is all but useless on a planet. In space it\\'s pretty much useless as well. And that\\'s the only navigation tool you have. Enjoy.\\nIt seems like there\\'s no way to look around inside your cockpit without VR-set. And in some cockpits navball and information screen just outside of your field of view. Enjoy.\\nYou cannot call the other ships. If you want to communicate, you should get close to that ship and wait for them to call you. Neat.\\n\\nBut i saved my favorite for the last.\\nYou could exchange navigational data for planetary chart on a space station. It\\'s the one of few ways to navigate on a planets. Well, \"navigate\". Planetary chart will point you nearest random building on a planet, so you could participate in some random encounter. Yes, it\\'s as useless as it sounds.\\nSo to obtain a planetary chart you should first obtain some nav-data. It\\'s not a problem, it\\'s everywhere, but it takes your precious inventory space.\\nSo, you at cartographer.\\n[olist]\\n[*]Start conversation with a cartographer\\n[*]Listen to his greeting message\\n[*]Wait for dialog options to appear\\n[*]Choose according dialog option\\n[*]Listen to his lengthy reply\\n[*]Wait for the game to return controls to you \\n[/olist]\\nCongratulations, you just exchanged ONE nav-data for ONE chart. Oh, you want two charts? Do it all over again. You want 5? You don\\'t want that, trust me.\\nBut there is an icing for a cake. There\\'s multiple flavors of charts.

       " \"Bought this game recently, was running fine, played about 10 hours now it won't START. Tried updating drivers, reinstalling, some other things suggested online, none work. So I have to give this a -100 review even though i enjoyed the game for the short time I played it. Never had this issue with any other game.\",\n",
       " 'After 3,500 hours of playing the game since Foundation (don\\'t worry! 2,500 of them is AFK farming during Atlas Rises. I have a life!), I can say I\\'ve quite enjoyed it for the most part, with the definition of most being 50.000000000000000000000000000001% of the time. And usually that\\'s doing relaxing walks on my home planet.\\nBut there are really, really annoying and aggravating things that prevent me from recommending the game just yet. Mainly the nerfed exploration (BIG ONE), the frustrating base building, those damn sentinels, the little things and the TONS of damage, I mean BUGS.\\n\\n1 - There are just TEN different kinds of terrain generation in a game with quintillions of planets, and each planet/moon can have just ONE. This is fine before NEXT when the landscapes can get really magnificent, but NEXT made it feel rather same-y after just a few planets or moons. Why not combine two or more of them for more variation? Same thing with the biomes too. Some planets can have just one terrain or biome while others can have two or more. Or maybe bring back the old terrain generation to some planets. (City planets or planets with village-like settlements please, though that\\'s probably just a dream hahahaha)\\n\\n2 - Colors are seriously nerfed. Not counting the mega-exotic planets, there are just 6 sky colors. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, pink. There are just 4 colors of water - Red, yellow, green and blue. In lush planets, there just 7. Red, yellow, brown, blue, green, violet, pink. Maybe 8 with the rare white grass. How about using more (like way more) color combinations so all planets will feel more unique?\\n\\n3 - Flora and fauna levels. What happened to this? Before NEXT, planets have varying levels of flora and fauna. I used to see planets that have barely any flora but lots of fauna, while others are lush forests with no fauna. No noise. Just peace and quiet in that planet. Now, all non-dead planets have lots of flora - the variety is dramatically lessened. Why!\\n\\n4 - I\\'m seeing almost, if not the same kind of fauna in almost every planet/moon I come across. It was a bit more varied before NEXT. Out of the several hundred, probably over a thousand planets I\\'ve explored, 95% of it have the same cow-like, rat-like, dog-like whatever creatures. It gets old real quick. The noises need to be more varied as well. It\\'s the same set of animal noises for every fauna. The same. The birds and flying worms don\\'t make a sound either. Just a dream: Bring back the sandworm.\\n\\n5 - I don\\'t know why, but building a base, especially larger ones, is FRUSTRATING. To me, it\\'s not the power system - I\\'m probably in the minority that likes it. It is how annoying and sometimes, difficult it is to place base parts. Some even require multiple weird steps to make, like stair \"railings\". Others will be \"invalid\" or something due to Atlas knows what. The ability to minutely rotate objects with the mouse wheel is also lost. Can\\'t just everything snap easy-peasy and validly so we can more easily build stuff. We can easily delete a wrongly placed floor tile or wall, instead of dealing with the annoying invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid oh my goodness why is the wall having a seizure invalid invalid invalid invalid everything? Or maybe add an angle-adjusting function so we won\\'t resort to glitch building all the time?\\n\\n6 - Sentinels. These things are A PLAGUE, those drones especially that make annoying machine sounds that vaguely resemble evil laughter. Just mining a tiny 1 yoctometer-sized rock alerts them. Their AI and the manner they spawn both seriously need reworks as they are a manifestation of annoyance. A REAL ANNOYANCE SO ANNOYING, EVEN YERSINIA PESTIS IS SCARED OF BEING ANNOYED AND PESTERED BY THEM PESTS. Sure I can just keep distance and watch them stupidly wonder what the heck is going on, but a lot of times, especially in survival mode, THEY JUST APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU WHILE DESTROYING TINY ROCKS WHICH MAKES THEM MAD AND GO PEW PEW.\\n\\n7 - Bugs. In the Beyond update, there are so many bugs, it\\'s insane. Why does every update, especially the big ones, have to be infested with colonies of bugs? Considering how huge the game is, updates having several bugs is fine. It can take a patch or 5 to fix. But several colonies of bugs? Some of which are so darn persistent they reincarnate to a different bug when they die? Err... what\\'s going on? Why release updates in such a bug-infested state?\\n\\n8 - The little things. OH BOY there are a lot here. When firing your weapon, instead of instant response, sometimes the avatar will twitch the gun for a second before firing, even if the weapon is already drawn. This has screwed me many times in intense battles against sentinel walkers and quads. Ship handling can still get unpredictable and twitchy, even in fighters with a full suite of S-class pulse engine upgrades. Pirates asking for just 10,000 units even if I have 200 Stasis Devices (worth about 3 billion units) in my starship. Enemy starships going through freighters. Pulse jumping to the rear of my freighter, only to clip through the engines and get stuck. Not getting any damage from Biologial Horrors as long as I hug the outside of an abandoned building\\'s wall, but I hope I won\\'t get clipped through or else I\\'ll reload my save and start collecting eggs again! Biological Horror spit dealing not that much damage. Lack of really powerful enemies, especially to players with S-class everything. Hostile fauna going through plants and birds and rocks and things when they want to eat me. Large refiners having portable capacity (250). Ceiling lights and floor lamps emit almost zero light. Not being able to swap items unless there is an empty slot. Why can\\'t I place a table in my base unless it\\'s the planet surface? Why are my base specialists\\' feet below the floor? Why is the wall invalid and having a seizure while building a base? Why is my FPS being flushed down the toilet as I\\'m flushing down myself and my starship down to the planet\\'s surface? The clouds don\\'t look as awesome as the one in the NEXT trailer. Why does every system have a ringed planet? Why do star systems always need to have life? I encountered star systems with nothing but dead planets in the past. I can\\'t evenly flatten the terrain with the terrain manipulator - I can just make holes or fill holes and hope that it is at least semi-flat. That small cutscene when using a manufacturing plant\\'s save thingy. Planet-wide storms occurring at regular intervals. Pirates attacking at regular intervals. Getting attacked by pirates in a supposedly uncharted system. My underground base being covered by terrain... yeah. Quite a lot and there\\'s more! But that\\'s what I have in mind right now. Anyways!\\n\\nAt its current state, even after playing the game for 3,500 hours, I still can\\'t recommend the game just yet. It still needs a lot more polish, tons more bug fixing, quality of life improvements and most especially, doing something about the exploration aspect. If Hello Games can at least nail the exploration aspect and call the most ruthless and merciless bug exterminator in existence, most of the more minor flaws, quirks and features will be set aside by most players. I wouldn\\'t mind a full-blown reset if that\\'s what it takes to get the exploration part right. And the bugs. They need to die.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my long \"review\" of the game!',\n",

I didn\\'t care for the missing pilot, I just wanted his ship. I dont care about those people in the thing that just showed up, I just saw a cool looking planet. I didn\\'t feel like my character had a reason to do anything the game wanted me to do, except for refilling my hazard protection to survive. The NPC\\'s told me what to do, the little computer on my back told me where to go, oblivious to my wants and needs. Some parts of it made me curious, like the time I found some ruins on a planet and dug them out to receive some piece of treasure that\\'s only purpose was to be sold. Wasn\\'t some ceremonial item from civilizations passed, just something to make a space-buck.\\n\\nAll you\\'ll be doing, at the game\\'s core, is mining materials. It doesn\\'t matter [i]why[/i] you\\'re shooting that rock, you just know that it has what you need inside of it and you\\'ll be damned if you don\\'t get any of it. Then you get a bigger laser that lets you remove materials that your mining laser can\\'t. And when you\\'re out in space and not going to another planet or one of the similar-to-the-last-systems space stations or fleets, you\\'ll be shooting--you guessed it--, asteroids.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\" Yeah this isn\\'t true. I\\'ve see the same rocks on planets that are impossibly far apart, the only thing different being their stats that are only available when you scan something. My friend has commented several times about how he \"has the same animal on my planet!\" while walking past the same cave-plants I\\'ve seen in the last four planet\\'s caves.\\n\\nThe menus.. I don\\'t like it. I feel like it could have been done differently, and using right-click to go back on everything feels unintuitive, even with the icon telling me to right-click to go back, I still hit ESC and end up pausing the game. Maybe I\\'m just \\'special\\' in this aspect. I\\'m also not a fan of how things move along and opposite of my mouse when in the menus. I just don\\'t like it in games that have it, it doesn\\'t make the menu more interesting, just makes it harder to hit the buttons. Destiny also has this and I dislike it there, too. \\n\\nThe part I was most excited for was learning the languages. I was hoping I could discover various ruins of the different races, learn each of their varied pasts, actually [i]study them[/i].. Instead I get to look for cylinders with circles in them for [i]each[/i] race. Yep, each race stores their memories in the exact same obsidian blocks as the other races. I tried to like what they did where you could do different things in the memory, but it\\'s pretty much a \"yes\" or \"no\".

       " 'I respect the hell out of what Hello Games has done to improve the state of this game. I played it at launch, and I played it again any time a major expansion released and each time it has gotten better and better. In its current state, there is much more to do, there are places to explore and a storyline to follow, and a \"point\" to gathering all of the materials: base building, upgrades, and more. For that, it is commendable - and I certainly appreciate a new space VR game to take some time out of Elite. \\n\\nBut this is still not a game that I can recommend. Hello Games has addressed the problem of there being nothing to do in the game but have failed to fix basic issues that keep turning me away from the game each time that I come back to it. These include: \\n\\n[list]\\n    [*] [b]Terrain pop-in.[/b] A game as massive as this will need to manage draw distance in some way, I understand that. What I cannot forgive is mountains and trees that change shape drastically several times as I fly toward them, or even worse appear out of thin air giving me no time to crash into them. Which leads me directly into: \\n    [*] [b]The wishy-washy flight model.[/b] Ships fishtail around in the sky and don\\'t differ meaningfully from each other in terms of handling, acceleration and features. Ships auto-accelerate and never fully stop, making it difficult to perform precise maneuvers. The game also babies you and tries its best to not let you crash into terrain. You have to be so precise with your aim in space combat that it is almost impossible to line up shots in a consistent manner. It just [i]doesn\\'t feel good[/i] to be in my spaceship in this game, whether in first or third-person view and in a game that is ostensibly about exploring the universe, this is unforgivable. To be clear: I don\\'t want Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen levels of realism in the flight model but I want to do ill-advised stunts through archways in the terrain, and juke enemies in an asteroid field and I want to do it all in a ship that feels responsive and accurate. \\n    [*] [b]The Color Palette and planet generation.[/b] Very, [i]very[/i] few planets that I have come across thus far have been interesting. Sure, there are neat plants and things to explore but 9/10 planets feel drab, lifeless, and marred by drastic color contrasts or uninteresting palettes. In the game I recently started, I went to a Red Planet, a Pink Planet, a Beige Planet, a Green Planet, another Red Planet, and finally another Beige Planet. None of them offered landscapes that were particularly interesting. Nothing I wanted to build a base on let alone explore for more than a few minutes to find the resources I need, and then get back off. Combined with the pop-in issues and generally unimpressive effects, textures and lighting I don\\'t ever want to remain planetside for longer than I have to. \\n    [*] [b]Performance Issues.[/b] My rig is running a Ryzen 3900X and a 2080 Ti with 16 GB of RAM. There should not be performance issues and yet when interacting with Knowledge Stones, entering atmospheres and at random points throughout the game I experience stutter, missed inputs and general frame drops. This isn\\'t in VR, it\\'s not in 4K, and my system usage isn\\'t maxing out when this happens either. \\n    [*] [b] Inventory Management.[/b] My God almighty this is unimpressive. The layout of your... what is it... six? seven maybe? separate inventories/technology layouts is unintelligible, clunky and difficult to manage on a controller. Simple as that, it\\'s bad. There have been updates addressing the most common QoL complaints but it needs a revamp from the bottom up to keep up with all the upgrades, separate materials and crafting components. It\\'s way too small and way too hard to manage. \\n[/list]\\n\\nI will keep coming back to No Man\\'s Sky every time there is an update. I really want this game to be great. I share Hello Games\\' vision of a \"Chill exploration experience,\" letting off steam laid back with my controller or with my headset captaining a ship through an exotic, surreal galaxy. But it cannot be [i]chill[/i] if I\\'m constantly managing my inventory. I don\\'t want to [i]explore[/i] when every planet is uninteresting and graphical glitches abound. And it\\'s not a good [i]experience[/i] when I don\\'t enjoy flying in my spaceship or dealing with performance issues. \\n\\nThis game is worth keeping up with, and not worth giving up on. I don\\'t think I ever will. I am impressed by how far it has come and am just waiting for that last extra step before I will enjoy it.',\n",

       " \"[b]Alright lets be honest here...[/b]\\nThe game has a great concept but the execution of it is less than stellar.\\n\\n[b]TLDR:\\nThe game is a great concept with poor execution. A game full of bugs, shallow story, shallow missions, shallow mechanics etc. It feels like an empty husk that looks cool from the outside.\\nI had fun with it but only because I had friends on discord to hang with while we playing it in separate instances because Multiplayer is a mess. The money and ship grind is the main time sink.[/b]\\n\\n\\nI played this game quite a while after the initial release and I had fun and now with the VR release I played it again at first it was fun but after a while you realize that all planets look very similar if not the same. \\nAlmost every single planet i went to had the oxygen plants that puff out toxic air and they had the cave rocks that also put out toxic air and not to mention the venus fly trap plant that hits you when you're not even close to it. \\nAll planets have the same looking buildings with the same looking aliens in them that say the same thing over and over. It's like taking to a kid that can only say 3 sentences.\\nAll trees look the same with different colors sometimes. \\nThe animals have a little bit of variety but in the end you're see the same hopping pineapple on a ton of planets as well. The animals also don't pose a single threat or have any interesting interactions to them at all. They feel like empty husks. Even if the animals are hostile to you they just run up to you and you get hit. But it's not really a threat.\\nEnvironmental damage like weather and such also poses no threat at all. Once again more of an empty husk.\\n\\nSo what we've established is that everything is essentially a shallow empty husk when it comes down to it.\\n\\n\\n[b]Lets talk about base building for a second![/b]\\nThe building in this game is not that great. There are instances where you'll think you should be able to place something down but it won't let you and that's just really frustrating. Like you can put railings in a certain spot next to stairs or you can't put stairs next to arches or you can't put a trading terminal on a wooden wall or the health and hazard modules you can put down don't work because it says you need power yet there is no way to hook them up to power.\\n\\nAlso when building in multiplayer the person who was at my base was not able to see the changes I was doing not to mention the lag you get when going to certain bases and I have a good rig to run games on.\\n\\n[b]I did try to build a couple bases and this is how it went:[/b]\\nI attempted to build a couple bases and my first base that I spent quite a while on was sunk into the ground when I came back one day totally ruining the build and I essentially had to delete it. Now I did not terraform anything to build this base so the bug (Is it a bug?) where the ground regrows in your base wasn't a thing here. It literally just moved underground and the top part was sticking out.\\n\\nThe second base I attempted to make also took me quite a while and I came back one day and it was tilted. It wasn't when I built it though. So that one got deleted. \\n\\nThe third base which I spent the most time on was amazing. But once again suddenly when I got back a terrain feature from that planet spawned in it and it wasn't there before. Not to mention the people I was playing with didn't even see it. It was only on my end. But that also ruined my base.\\n\\nAfter those 3 instances I honestly stopped trying... Imagine spending hours on a base just to have it ruined by bugs over and over again and you can't do anything about it.\\n\\n\\n[b]Lets talk about multiplayer now...[/b]\\nTrying to join someone in multiplayer is an actual nightmare... I would join someone and they wouldn't be able to see me. Ships that land at trading posts and space stations would have different stats for both of us. Sometimes ships would land in each other. \\nNexus group quests would be fun to do even though they're super easy and having a group for it isn't even needed at all but once you go back to try and turn it in you might get put in a different nexus instance essentially making it so you can't see each other anymore even if you go back to the same system and you'd have to go through the nightmare of rejoining again.\\n\\nLong story short is that my friends and I essentially had to play solo and just talk in discord for the most part instead of actually playing together because of the huge amount of bugs associated with it not to mention the lag when going to each others bases.\\n\\nOnce again Multiplayer is a empty husk of nothingness.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about ships, frigates and freighters?[/b]\\nShips and freighters is going to be your main time sink in this game. Finding a ship or freighter you like and then getting it in the highest class you can might take you 10 minutes or days. \\nMaking money for those ships might also take you quite a while unless you decide to use cheats, exploits or broken mechanics which a lot of people do. \\n\\nAs for frigates which are the small ships that come with freighters. You can send them on quests and get rewards for it. It's essentially a shallow mechanic. \\nNot to mention the fact that once frigates get damaged in a mission and they get back you might not be able to fix them so then you just have to delete them from your fleet so if you spent the time to find S class frigates you can say bye bye to your time spent and the money you spent hiring the frigate.\\n\\nWhat happened to me is that my frigates got back and I had to repair them. In order to do that you need to land on the frigate however the landing pads were broken meaning you couldn't land on them and therefor you couldn't repair them.\\n\\nYou also can't change colors on ships which lets be honest here should be a thing in a game like this specially after all this development time. Even a simple mechanic where you can re-roll a ships paint job through their random generation system for a fee at a space station or something would be good enough.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about mission? How about the story?[/b]\\nMissions are the same shallow missions over and over again that are super easy and honestly not worth doing. \\n\\nThe story is uninteresting and shallow. They just have you jumping all over the place to add game time and say it's content but in reality it's just padding in my opinion. In fact you might go through the entire story only to have your decision at the end bug out your entire game.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about flying and how about VR?[/b]\\nFlying around is pretty good once you get used to it and in VR it feels really nice to fly around. \\nI haven't had any motion sickness at all which is a very good thing. I have to give them credit for that one.\\nThe game however is very poorly optimized and not just for VR and still carries a lot of simple VR bugs with it at the writing of this review.\\n\\nThat being said the ship combat is once again not that great. it's the same thing over and over. Oh pirates want your stuff... Oh you won't give it to them? Lets have you spend some time killing these ships that don't pose a single threat what so ever and have nothing good for loot. They're just an annoyance.\\nI must say that ship combat in VR is a lot more interesting but in the end it boils down to the same thing.\\n\\n\\nThat's pretty much it.\\nThere are better games to spend your money on that aren't as shallow as this game is.\",\n",

Our initial efforts to play the game were plagued by problems. First and foremost among them, was a disassociation between what each of us was experiencing, despite being in game together. She would frequently get assaulted and killed by hostile animals, despite them being invisible and unaffectable to me. Similarly, I was overwhelmed by storms, while she saw clear skies. After a week of this sort of play, we threw our hands up in frustration. \\nIn an attempt to salvage the experience, I suggest we explore in Creative mode, and see what the game had to offer, and perhaps spend some time designing bases on worlds we liked the look of. Though this experience gave us a few more days of play, it was repetitive, unengaging, and generally a huge letdown.\\nI haven't explored this game in single player mode much, but after seeing the limits to what CAN be researched, designed, explored, and created, I have to say I can't imagine spending much more time in this game. The worlds, aliens, and missions are stunningly repetitive. Uncovering alien languages seems neat initially, but it is frustratingly slow (who learns new languages one word at a time?) and requires hearing the same alien dialogue over and over again.\\nI'm still hopeful that Hello Games will continue to upgrade and improve this game, but at this point in its iteration, it's decidedly underwhelming still.

Why each upgrade have they own energy pool anyway?

Those helpful hints quickly become VERY annoying as they ruin the realism of the game and cannot be turned off.  I played this game on the PS4 about a year ago.

After hours and hours of play I hit yet another of the endless bugs.  Suddenly I cannot edit the main part of my base.. The base only has about 15 items but it seems that is some sort of limit.  This is where I stopped.  I have had enough.  But the most frustrating bug of all is when you are in VR choosing the build menu.  Some careless  programmer switched the menus.  So when you see the menu and select an item in the tree it is on the right.  But after you enter the menu it is on the left... so.. you find yourself in the wrong menu EVERY TIME!

What's that? You just placed removed a floor and can't add it back again?

Never mind the countless of times where you can't put something where you want it, despite there being no good reason whatsoever as to why you can't.\\n- Not having your ship spawn inside existing things. You just made your base next to something pre-existing, to continue a nice symbiotic relationship. But lo and behold, the game decides to just plant your ship inside their building when you get back to your base.\\n- An amazing storyline where you learn to use portals to go anywhere in the universe. ...only to be locked into that system, making portals entirely useless. I understand the devs don't want people rushing towards the end, but why not? Let people play how they want to play.\\n- An innovative way to learn 3 different languages. By taking 30 seconds every time you want to learn a new word because you have to click 3 buttons and go through 5 different slow text boxes to get there, and there being no good other way to learn these languages. There's like 10K words for each language.\\n- A fun way to edit terrain. You can simply paint spheres onto terrain or dig spheres into terrain, middle finger to anyone who likes to make tidy bases, amirite?\\n- GUI to be intuitive and easy to use. Because nobody likes going through 5 different menus and long lists to earn a specific currency in the game, while in a previous version you had a singular button that would do all of that for you.

And I\\'m not sure I\\'d recommend it even then until there are more updates.\\n\\nThe problem with NMS -- the thing that ultimately made me say, \"Eh, time to try something else\" -- is that the \"world\" feels so small and unvaried. \\n\\nYou are ostensibly an explorer in an endless galaxy, able to visit infinite worlds, and yet every world you visit feels like a differently-colored version of the same world, inhabited by the same sentient alien races, with the same set-pieces and the same rewards. After you\\'ve been to a dozen or so star systems, all sense of wonder is gone because every star system has one of three versions of the same space station, is controlled by one of the same three races, and consists of somewhere between one and a dozen worlds that look essentially like every other world you\\'ve previously visited.\\n\\nPut another way: NMS is premised on exploration but for all intents and purposes you\\'re done with the exploration about 20 - 30 hours into the game because by that point you\\'ve met every NPC alien race, seen every architectural set piece, harvested the same resources on the same five or six types of planets, seen the same two or three types of freighter ships, etc. Some examples of what I\\'m talking about:\\n\\n* There are a couple varieties of freighter ships, including some admittedly beautiful rare ones. But the interior of every freighter is exactly the same, so it kind of doesn\\'t matter. Same thing with space stations: every star system has one, but every station is, on the inside, exactly the same.\\n\\n* There are buildings and ruins scattered on every planet, but all the buildings, etc., use the same handful of models, but with different colors. So irrespective of how strange the world itself looks (and very, very few of them look genuinely strange or \"alien\"), the \"places\" you visit on each planet are the same.\\n\\n* There are three sentient races and they apparently populate every star system throughout the galaxy. You\\'ll never meet a previously undiscovered NPC race, or make contact with an obscure alien empire -- you\\'re only ever going to meet one of three alien types. \\n\\nNMS is, to me, a poor man\\'s Subnautica. The contrast between the two games really highlights how you can achieve a better sense of wonder and fear and discovery with a carefully-curated setting where there\\'s real, artistic variety between biomes and among creatures -- where exploration allows you to explore further, deeper, into more dangerous places that feel different than any place you\\'ve ever been before -- than in a game that simply takes place in an \"infinite\" galaxy where everything is basically a dozen shades of the same thing.\\n\\nNMS has the bones of a truly ground-breaking and amazing experience. But it\\'s not worth $60 USD. Perhaps in an update or two, with more variety or a better story (don\\'t even get me started on how sloppy and predictable that was), it will be that game.',\n",

However:\\n\\nThe UI is a Frankenstein\\'s monster of botched console port and poor design decisions. During development and in the 3 years since release, no apparent effort has been made to adapt the UI to PC. Every button, every menu and every screen handles akwardly and screams \"made for console\". The current patch introduced the biggest advancement in this area since 3 years ago: The duration for which you have to hold your mouse button to make a click has been reduced from ~2s to almost instant in various menus.\\nOnce you have finally reached your desired menu, the functions are lacking and information is poorly visualized whereever not absent. Even the most basic features like the solar system and galaxy maps are barely functional and would be an embarrasment even for an Indy-game in Alpha made by 2 people.\\n\\nEven after more than a dozen patches in roughly a week, the game remains buggy and has been so for years. While the effort to provide patches quickly is commendable, the fact that the new update was released in such a state gives you an idea of value HG places on quality-assurance and -control, and a sinister forshadowing of the amount of bugs amd issues you will encounter while playing.\\nContinuing the reoccuring theme of \"botched, half-assed and broken\", even content that is years old still is troubled by basic and glaring issues. To give an example: If you google the problem that terrain is regenerating back into bases and buildings you built, you will find threads from over a year ago. HG said that they were looking into it, the issue remains unsolved to this day.\\n\\nIn general many features feel unfinished and rushed, even reworks used to promote the \"new big update\" are made half-assed: While the player inventory was increased to be able to hold dozens of large stacks of items, HG did not update a single one of the various other inventories(ships, freighters, storage containers, ...), leaving them grotesquely out of line.

       " \"I returned to No Man's Sky Beyond after the initial No Man's Sky PS4 release in 2016. I left at some point because it reached a plateau where things felt stagnant and became more of the same grinding. Now in 2019, with a Valve Index and powerful PC, and, of course, all of the exciting developer updates in Beyond, I was super excited for the VR space adventure. Alas, the bubble has burst after my last few game experiences. Crashing after exploring a good hour on a planet (losing all progress), aliens buried in the floor when talking to them, and ultimately no longer loading in (crashing after a 10 minute load time wait, when nothing has changed since my last game). All these took me out of the immersive VR experience that could have been. It feels like this game has gotten too top heavy for its good. I appreciate the patch after patch release, but it ultimately made my game experience so unstable, I've completely aborted the No Man's Sky mission once again. It's too bad, because it has so much potential to be the best VR game experience. But when you lose precious time to game breaking technical issues, it's just not worth your investment. Try, if you must. But it won't do. I really wanted to like this game, but it's a broken black hole. Not recommended.\",\n",
       " \"Ok here is my honest review of NSM. Iv’e been playing for around a week and I can say NMS is a fun enjoyable game in concept. \\nThere is plenty to do, enough to keep you going & without being tedious or too time-consuming. Following the mission's path is fun when it works and the game won't put huge roadblocks in your way to progression, at least early on. \\nTo start with it was very enjoyable and I was looking forward to progressing into all that NMS has to offer.\\nHowever, there is one big fat massive elephant in the room & that's the fact that almost every system in the game is either poorly designed or even worse is riddled with game-breaking bugs.\\nNMS, a game that’s been in full release since 2016! It is so broken that actual Early access/Pre-release games put it to shame. \\nJust a few examples of game-breaking bugs I have encountered that are so fundamental to the core of the game. 1. Logging off in the Anomaly (the multiplayer hub) can spawn you outside of the Invisible barrier of the playable space when you reload the game, with no way to escape. I had to use a 3rd party save file editor to change the position of my character to save my entire save game. 2. Bounty Encounters do not reward the currency for completing them. 3. The inventory expansion vendor does not charge you giving you free upgrades. 4. Some building blocks don't work i.e the Medical unit pivotal in healing your character without endlessly hunting crates on planets 5. Electrical hookup points just stop showing after aiming a wire at them causing you to reload the game every time you want to make an electrical connection. 6. Many “treasures” appear under the mesh of the planet below the excavatable material. 7. Items get stuck in storage telling you that your inventory is full even though it's empty. 8. Some blueprint pictures don't match their items/descriptions making it very frustrating to find what you thought you purchased. 9. Putting quick menu functions on the “Hotbar”(1-9) will all default to summon ship after a jump or teleportation. Ok, more than a few but I could sit here typing all day with issues I've had. I've been taking screenshots and OBS recordings, submitting bugs more than you would In any Early access game.\\nMoving on to poor game design first on the list is it's clear that NMS was developed for console and PC was an afterthought or a non-thought and clearly goes Consol>VR>>>>>>>>PC Basic functions like Keybinding are tedious as binding requires you to do though many “Quick Menus” (Which is broken anyway) and you cannot bind anything to the scroll wheel. Which would be useful for changing multitool functions but instead you have to mash G. You cant bind them individually to number keys either and ofc you cant use a hotas with NMS. \\nThe game gives you 4-5 different building sets that don't play well together mixing and matching is a mistake you will regret when things won't place at all or line up Furthermore Tech items cant be placed on some building types and others just won't place at all. Want a Large refiner on basic building sure go ahead. Try to place a medium nope you need to put it in the Large building prefab… Want to place storage inside. Good luck you have to place it outside on the terrain unless you Cheat it by placing a foundation strut on a Normal foundation then delete it after leaving the storage floating less have unsightly poles sticking down under your base. All this meanwhile your building from layers upon layers of clunky cumbersome scroll menus. Overall navigating the menus and systems of NMS is confusing and unintuitive, having to question basic functions on the game's discord regularly.  Then discovering that long-time players didn't even know you could do what you're asking like binding quick menu items to 1-9. So that changing from 1st -3rd person can be 1 button press and not a 4 “quick menu”  navigation task. \\nSo would I recommend NMS the answer is no! The concept is good. The execution is terrible. The coders must suffer from hand Tourette's with the number of bugs and broken features and the QA team must be huffing glue to let so many things slide by. \\nThe only good thing about NMS is its great discord community  \\n\",\n",

The indicator was still there but then again, and this gets on my nerves, even when you deplete a deposit the indicator is still there so when you get turned around on a barren world you trek back to a hole in the ground that, according to the scanner should be full of something.\\nAgain small issue that adds up.\\nThen the indicator of what element made up trees and rocks stopped working and I wrote this review.\\nStop adding content.

       " \"No Man's Sky is by far the buggiest game I have ever played, so far in my playthrough, I have fallen through the map literally countless times. My game has crashed probably 20+ times and there is always a visual bug present. These bugs are completely unacceptable for a $60 3-year-old triple A-game. Not only are there bugs but the game is so poorly optimized that running the game on any decent settings can cause even beefy systems to take huge fps drops. The game certainly has fun aspects to it, the economic system is pretty enjoyable, the missions are for the most part good, and the upgrade system is nice. The only part of the whole experience that is done exceptionally well is the sheer scale of things. The amount of room you have to do what you want is amazing. Planets feel huge and considering solar systems can have 6+ planets per system that means you have just insane amounts of room. The issue lies in what is done with this room, while yes there is nearly infinite space to build on, there just simply isn't a lot to build. The base building mechanics are very simple and for a lot of people won't even change how they play the game. Having a base is not remotely essential, you gain nothing but shelter and access to missions by building a base. The best or at least the most profitable aspect of base building is farms you can make with mineral extractors that bring in millions of dollars entirely passively. These are decently easy to make and only require some buried tech and a few million dollars to buy materials (if you can't get them on your own.) This completely changes the balance of the game, suddenly that $40 million ship is no longer an insane investment that will bankrupt you but it's just a few hours of waiting. Trying to get a lot of money without a farm is pretty hard but arguably more enjoyable. Doing this will consist of you looking for ancient bones or salvageable tech. This means you have to find planets that have either one of these and then actually explore said planet. This makes money feel genuinely valuable and like a reward rather than something you just have. Back on the topic of base building, say you wanted to make a base and live in it what would that take? Well for starters your gonna need constant power, this would be fine if the power system was even remotely balanced. At first, you will probably make a bio-fuel generator, this will power a base for a very short time at the cost of a whole lot of carbon or oxygen, this is absolutely insane considering that solar panels are just a bit more expensive and will power your base for free. After you have your base powered with a few batteries and solar panels you will likely upgrade that to an electromagnetic generator. This is by far the easiest and most abundant source of power in the entire game. A single electromagnetic generator will power huge bases for just the cost of building it (which is incredibly low.) This is not balanced at all, you can literally power everything you can possibly want for super cheap and entirely passively. Even ignoring the power imbalance the actual wiring mechanics are horrid. This is a game where you talk to otherworldly lifeforms, can warp hyperspace, and literally teleport, and yet for some reason, there is no wireless power. What in the hell was Hello Games thinking? the wiring system is the least intuitive thing out of the entire game. Wires are always visible and will go through walls, they are huge as hell and make weird jagged angles, you can't connect wires from one base to another, etc. Trying to power something like a door is so confusing, for starters when a door is powered it is closed, why the hell is is that? There are no buttons automatically on a door so you have to go out and research them, after you have researched a button you place it on the door, power the door, and nothing happens. Buttons don't actually work on doors because for some reason power flows through the button into the door and is never shut off. Now you have to go back and research a lever or power inverter and try that. Finally, you get back, set everything up and now you can enter your base. At this point you realize that all you have build is a single door. \\n\\n\\n     The combat in this game is split into 2 parts, ground based player combat, and space combat. The player combat consists of fighting small drones called sentinels which come in waves that lead up to a huge walker robot that has 5 protective plates before you can hurt its actual health. This combat is not at all entertaining and feels more like a chore than it does a game mechanic. Not only is it boring but it doesn't reward you in the slightest. Often time fighting sentinels will be forced upon you since they will attack you if you mine anything near them, shoot any animals near them, or sometimes just are near them. If the player had any way of taking them out rapidly this wouldn't be as bad, however, all the weapon options are absolutely terrible. None of the weapons do any decent damage and all frequently require charging or reloading, this means most of your fighting will be done with the mining laser which is the most consistent weapon in the game but it is also slow and boring to use. On the topic of space fights the verdict is almost the same. Once more fights are forced upon you by hostile sub-space scans. These scans will appear at random while you are in space and can be avoided if you give the hostiles a typically large amount of money. Refusing to give them money will cause 1-5 hostile ships to warp in front of you, prevent you from warping and force you to slowly turn you ship to chip away their incredibly tiny, far away ship. There should be either no space combat or an entirely reworked system of space combat. All of these problems are just amplified in the new VR addition which is somehow more buggy than the base game. Give this game another 3 years in the oven and maybe it will be worth the full price.\",\n",

Buttons and other widgets move around trying to follow the cursor in a distracting manner. I have to long-click most things in order to activate them. I switched from keyboard/mouse to an XBox Elite controller which makes the interface quirks a bit more tolerable in my opinion.\\n\\nI spawn on a planet that has some sort of hazard, and I need sodium to prevent my spacesuit from melting. Off I go to harvest some sodium from glowing yellow plants. I have to manually recharge the spacesuit with the sodium I gathered, which is unnecessarily awkward to do, then head to my spaceship, which won't take off because it is damaged. I must follow instructions on screen in order to get materials and craft what I need to repair it. The whole thing is quite confusing but gets me flying.\\n\\nI take off and try to hover, but the ship will not stay put. It will always inch forward. It's not that it needs lift from moving forward as it's going too slowly for that. It just refuses to lower itself to the level of a helicopter. In most simulators the yoke works as in a real airplane, which means that if I pull on it it the nose of the spaceship will rise, but here it does the opposite. Also the yoke's lateral movement usually controls roll, but here it is yaw. I guess I'll just get used to face planting every time I take off, or eventually get around to remapping the controller.\\n\\nFlying out of the planet's atmosphere feels great, although space looks excessively bright, has way too many densely-packed asteroids that appear from nowhere, and planets are too close together. It's like flying through an impressionist painter's idea of space.\\n\\nI spend a few hours playing and I still need to get over my instinct to pull the yoke to go up, but that's not my biggest source of frustration. For a game that seems to be focused on collecting materials and crafting things out of them, managing inventories is confusing. Different categories of things such as raw materials, crafted stuff, deployable structures and upgrades all go in the same type of generic slot. They are not even color-coded in a way that makes any sense. The very limited slot count in the exosuit inventory is downright irritating.\\n\\nOn the subject of being irritated, I find myself staring at the laser beam that comes out of my multi-tool a lot longer than I would like to, not because I'm having a blood-pumping fight against some powerful antagonist. I fire the laser at a tree for a few seconds, the tree quivers and then it is gone. I fire the laser at a rock, the rock quivers and it is gone. I question my life's choices as I fire the mining laser at every inanimate object I find in order to get a trickle of materials that I can use to craft one annoying trinket after another that I need in order to accomplish the most basic of tasks.\\n\\nI set out on a boring quest to get fifty units of oxygen, ten units of sodium, a hundred units of copper, and three hundred units of iron to craft a metal pipe to hit myself repeatedly over the head in order to get enough brain damage so that I can continue playing.\\n\\nMost of the time I am not flying around enjoying the breathtaking scenery, anticipating the next adventure, trying to figure out some mystery or soaking in the story. Instead I am frantically running around trying to get more sodium, oxygen or copper in order to fix a valve in my suit through which my soul is being drained, Then I'll be able to look for something fun to do, maybe on the next planet, maybe on the next station. Before that happens I discover that I need to get more iron to craft another metal pipe because the first one broke after a hundred blows.\\n\\nMaybe this is not the right game for me. Maybe I don't care about collecting all the sodium, oxygen or copper that I can scavenge. Maybe I don't care about different but oddly similar alien dinosaurs or poisonous exploding plants. I don't care about wisdom stones that teach me a single word of some alien language. It's all such a boring chore that I'm going to take my helmet off the next time a radioactive super-heated storm hits so that I can put an end to my misery in the most painful way possible.

       " \"Played initially on PS4, bought this on PC exclusively to try out VR.\\n\\nI'm leaving this as feedback, it's not meant to be critical, and i'd like to point out that this review is especifically for the VR portion of the gameplay. The game itself is a nice sandbox, one of the best single player (Can't get friends to play this) sandboxes out there. The game itself deserves a positive review, but since I bought it on PC to try out VR especifically i'm going to point out the reasons that I are making it hard or unpleasant to play. I will gladly change if more options are added to acoomodate the VR experience.\\n\\nOk, here goes my comments:\\n\\nI usually play all VR games that require a lot of hours to get thru seated.  I adjust my height so it feels natural, sit down on a swivel chair, and my preferred motion scheme is smooth locomotion with smooth turning.  This works out GREAT in games like Skyrim and OrbusVR. It lets me sit comfortably, without losing any of the mobility that would be crucial to playing it properly, and at the same time allows for longer playsessions. \\n\\nNo Man's Sky tries to offer these locomotion settings, but the implementation is very poor at the moment. The sensitivity on the smooth turning makes it almost impossible to not get a little bit sick, it's just too sensitive, and its all or nothing. The games that do this best usually scale the turning speed to how far from the center of the touchpad your finger is. This lets you control exactly how you are turning, making the experience a lot better. \\n\\nAlso, let us use the left touchpad to move. Touching it to move, letting us strafe with it. If i press left on the touchpad it should strafe me left, up move forward, back move backwards. Ideally just the touch should move you, and if you press it should be considered a sprint.\\n\\nThis makes it SO much easier to move around, and gives you full control over the character. It goes a long way to make the locomotion smooth.  Pressing the trigger to move is so unintuitive, it makes it a pain to move around and feels AWFUL.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\nNow for the spaceship controls.  They are perfect in terms of responsiveness.  I really felt like I had the controls in my hand. My onloy comment is, usually when you are flying a ship with a stick, when you turn it left you expect to roll, and the touchpad should serve as a rudder, strafing the ship left or right. This should at least be an option. Would make it feel so much more real when flying.\\n\\n-----------------------\\n\\nAs for the survival experience I have one more comment to make. \\n\\nI've had a Vive for a while now, and the one thing that is a constant for me when I play a normal game that went VR, be it Skyrim, Falltout 4, or Subnautica, is that you spend a LOT more time letting the scenery kick in. It's a much slower pace, you aren't always in a rush to get into your destination. \\n\\nWhen I playing skyrim I think i spent an hour alone in bleak falls barrows, the first dungeon, it's just a TRIP to look at every little detail in the environment around you. \\n\\nConsidering this, it would be nice if you could spawn VR players in less hostile worlds for the first landing. You die at least once just trying to get a hold of the controls your first time spawning, because unlike PC you don't want to frantically go after supplies to stay alive, hopping from cave to cave. It would be nice to even walk to destinations instead of running, and its just too steep of a cliff to drop someone in when they are immersed like that. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I think it would make the beginning of the survival experience a LOT more VR friendly. \\n\\n\\nI will be happy to try this again if these changes are ever put into the game. As of right now, I couldn't stand to get past the survival experience in the beginning, and had to load a save to use a spaceship. I am dying to get into my character, but the immersion just goes away with these controls.\",\n",

Also can say again for certain that the controls were not developed with PC VR systems or smooth movement in mind at all.\\n\\n1) You are able to punch things by actually punching them with your controller.

You  can only do the quest at one of them but if you use a built portal to get there fast, the quest marker  keeps changing the computer, so you actually have to travel there by ship. oh and please don\\'t do time gated quests in a fucking (mostly) single player game. Needing over 15 hours to do a questline that could have been finished in 1 hour because of time gating just makes it seem like they need to do it to make it seem like there is more content.\\n[*]Animals bugging out and not doing anything\\n[*]Aliens on space station lying on the floor without you being able to talk to any of them\\n[*]Materials sometimes disappearing from refiners\\n[*]Visor showing resource deposits where there are none (and no, it was not already mined)\\n[*]Not getting money from bounty missions\\n[*]Getting stuck in landing animation and having to restart the game\\n[*] Starting a conversation with aliens sometimes doesn\\'t show any text\\nand many more...\\n[/olist]\\n\\nmultiplayer bugs:\\n[olist]\\n[*]getting desynced so that you don\\'t see your friend in game without restarting the game\\n[*]When inspecting/comparing ships, the same ships have different values and inventory slots for you than for your friend\\n[*]Bounties for pirates have different values for you than for your friend (doesn\\'t matter as you don\\'t get paid anyway and the moment someone of you engages the ships, they disappear for your friend, so you can\\'t actually fight together)\\n[/olist]\\n\\nmultiplayer \"features\":\\n[olist]\\n[*] you can\\'t use the trade terminal at the same time\\n[*] you can\\'t talk to the same merchant at the same time (which is not even needed for synchronisation as the merchant has a separate inventory for each of you)\\n[*] You don\\'t even do the main story quests together, you do them one after the other.

Sure, I am only halfway through the main story, but during that half it felt like I was doing the same quests over and over again and doing the same stuff I was already doing when exploring planets  just with 4-5 lines of, sometimes scrambled, story text added to it.\\n\\nIf you still want to play the game, go ahead, I had at least some fun, but I would certainly recommend you to not buy it at full price.',\n",

       " 'TL;DR One of the worst, if not THE worst, single player experiences on Steam. One of the best, if not THE best, multi-player experiences on Steam.\\n$60? NOPE. $30? MAYBE. $15? TAKE MY MONEY!\\n\\nNot enough bad to be a \"No,\" but too much bad to be a straight out \"Yes\"\\n\\nThe UI isn\\'t that friendly as it places common commands/interactions behind several layers of navigation when they should really be a single keystroke, not to mention the menus are actually on timers (they will disappear on you after a few seconds of inactivity rather than closing on your command). This can be a pain early on when you have absolutely no idea where anything is in the menu or what it does. The tutorial leaves much to be desired as it has you do action-similar tasks step-by-step rather than giving an overall goal with a \"to-do list\" so you can complete the task more efficiently, e.g. repairing your starter ship, you are sent out to recover on component and then return to the ship for the tutorial to proceed to \"Step 2.\" Of course, you CAN go out and get all the materials, but only if you already know you can do this and know what you need to gather. \\n\\nVariety is SORELY lacking. I find this disconcerting as it was one NMS\\'s primary selling points. Planets quickly become indistinguishable as you slowly realize there are very few climates and only a handful of \"dangerous\" traits (I say \"dangerous\" because these hazards are easily overcome/avoided). Animals and plants are generally similar, although I don\\'t know if the common/uncommon/rare occurrence references the planet or the universe as a whole; you will find similar, even identical, species on multiple planets/systems. The limited selection in variations quickly leads to what seems to be copy-paste content despite being \"procedurally generated.\"\\n\\nCombat is lackluster. Animals are no real threat as most run off as you kill them. Sentinels, the primary defenders of valuable resources and commodities planet-side, are easily defeated/evaded; like GTA, just runaway or hide until your warrant level disappears and your back in business. Again, no real threat. Space battles aren\\'t that complex, they consist of pirates spawning because reason and you shooting them down. Their tactics are simple in that they speed straight towards you, aligning themselves to your line of fire, no aiming required. The random dogfight is hardly a fight as you simply sidestep, turn, and fire.\\n\\nResources are abundant and infinite; if you can\\'t find something just go to another planet/system, eventually you will find it in great supply. What makes them infinite is that they actually respawn after a short period. Find a rare mineral/resource? Hope you have the tech to mine it; be prepared to hold on to it as you\\'re going to have  to find a system with a station that values the find enough to pay you what it\\'s worth. Of course, having a freighter completely relieves the inventory concerns. Speaking of freighters...\\n\\nBase building is nearly pointless as far as I\\'ve experienced. Anything you can do on a base, aside from hiring a handful of aliens to \"work\" the base, can be done on your freighter which you\\'ll likely pick up in your first 10 hrs of play (10 hrs is a generous over-estimation as you will likely acquire one in the first system or two you explore). And if you DO decide to build a base, be prepared for physics defying overhangs, ugly corners, and unnecessary mechanics. All-in-all, this game sucks...\\n\\nThat is unless you\\'ve got some good friends to play with. While the game is incredibly tedious on your own, having a couple mates to fly around with adds a whole lot to the experience. Take you crew through system hoping adventure of discovery. Setup a mining colony to farm up some credits. Find and repair a crashed ship to add to your collection. Uncover the mysteries of the alien life forms that populate the universe. While these ALL deal with the negative aspects I find with the game, adding a multiplayer aspect is enough to gloss over those shortcomings. It has been my experience, however, that people don\\'t tend to trust those they don\\'t know in game so it doesn\\'t seem likely you will find many others willing to join up (admittedly this is anecdotal, but is accurate for the roughly 100 hours I\\'ve put into the game).\\n\\nIn summary, HG still has some serious work to do to make this the $60 title they promised at launch, but it is well on its way. For $30 you might consider picking it up if you have a few others to play with or don\\'t mind the mind-numbing repetition. On sale, it\\'s a definite buy.',\n",

Gather resources and build stuff; explore and survive; ground and ship fighting...\\n\\nThere are 54 \"raw materials\" and 81 \"crafted products\". And the list of \"raw materials\" even includes refined materials! You can get most on your first planet. Go to a hand full and you have everything. There could be so much more ...\\n\\nGathering resources and building: You can only build bases and the design does feel kinda limited. If you wanna build stuff, try \"Empyrion - Galactic Survival\" or \"Space Engineers\". There you can build whatever you want / can imagine (as soon as you get used to it). Those games do have their own flaws, the gameplay itself is mediocre, but in terms of building they show how it is done.\\n\\nExploring and survival: Try \"Subnautica\". Realy short, but so great. I am waiting for \"Below Zero\". This is a great example what exploring and survival can be like. Oh, and a good plot you can actually care for...\\n\\nFighting: I don´t know. But fighting in \"No Man´s Sky\" is lame! So I can buy a Class S Fighter? Cool! But I take down every single enemie with my class C Shuttle (I bought just for transport capacity)... I get hit, shields are reduced... and then they just recharge. I get hit again, reduced, recharged... and so on. Oh, how exciting....    Nope!\\n\\n\\nSo: You want all of this in one game and you don´t care if every single concept isn´t well thought out? Then you can try \"No man´s sky\". If you want one or another concept to be realy good: Maybe try something else.\\n\\nI wanted to try myself, and now I think I should have listened to all the bad reviews and skipped this. I mean if you do not care for the money (if you spend hundreds of $ each year on games) you can try this game any way. If you have little money to spend and you realy have to decide what to buy, I would advise you to buy another game.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOriginal: I enjoyed some hours, some hours where boring as hell, some where frustrating. After all I have a mixed fealing...\\n\\n\\nMy main complains are:\\n\\nI flyed from space station to space station. All looked pretty much the same. Then I ran around and talked to all aliens. Each space station has one or two \"individuals\", that ask for something and you can choose an answer out of 3 options. The impact is low, but OK. After some time you will find the same \"individuals\" all over again.\\nAll of the other alliens are pretty much the same. They say something to greet you, you can ask them to teach you a new word and they will. You could give a gift to raise your reputation with their race, doesn´t matter which one you give it. And you can practice your language, giving you the option to choose one of 4 words, of which none will ever do something good. It´s either wrong or terribly wrong, causing loss of reputation. And thats it...\\nI do understand they are not able to programm millions of individual aliens. I just wish there was more to it than it is now. After some time I stoped talking to aliens at all, cause it was just boring. It´s cool to have a huge universe with so many aliens, but as it is now, it´s just as bad as if there where none... They are just like soulless creatures I couldn´t care less for.\\n\\nI startet exploring my starting planet and scanned every mineral, every plant, every animal. I loved it, what a cool feature... Then I flew to the next planet and scanned a lot. Then the next... OK. That is kind of borring too... You get some units for it, but I don´t need those. You get the entry, with little information and a pic. I stoped doing that too.\\n\\nThe universe is so big. Yet it feels so empty.. (OK maybe this is how space actually is, I don´t know. But this is a game, this should entertain me somehow...)\\n\\nThere are some other, small problems that bother me. Like when I make a wooden room, place a weapons terminal and the back flows in the air. I think this might just be wrong placement. So I replace it. Can´t place it properly. I search the forums. Find an entry from one year ago... They don´t seem to care to fix those little cosmetic \"issues\"... This is not game breaking, of course. But it makes my base a bit ugly, and base building is one of the aspects I actuelly like. And I think such things could be fixed...\\nWhen I place a floor, place something on the floor and the I realise, it looks better if I rotate the floor, I can remove the floor, but I cannot add it back without removing the thing on it first.\\nAnd so on...\\nSmall issues that add up. Just enough to get on my nerves.\\n\\nAnd if you start reading problems other players have at the forums... oh my.... Maybe some comments overdo it a little bit, I don´t know. But the game seems to have some serious issues...\\n\\n\\nThere are good stuffs though:\\n\\nAs I said, I like the base building. I gathered resources, started building, removed, rebuilded. The grind was OK, now I am able to simply buy resources. I got more and more things to build, needed more resources to do so. This is what I expected.\\nOf course, I do not spend a lot of time at my base, but I still like it.\\nAnd I really love that you can actually get aliens to your base! Doesn´t make your base feel so empty. Aliens that do have a character! Aliens that are not only soulless creatures! Oh how I wish there where more of those! Why not more of those?\\n\\nNow, with those aliens at my base I got some side quests and something to do, thats is good.\\n\\nAnd I like the trading aspect. At every space station I write down what they buy and sell (not all of it, only what I think is important) and I make a route, planing how to get good income. I wish they where more individual though. If they like product z, you know they also like product y and x... If they sell product z, you know they also sell product y and x... I´d like them to shuffle that to make it more interesting. But nevermind, making money is still one of the fun aspects of this game for me.\\n\\nOther ppl seem to really love the game as it is. (I hope they don´t tear me apart for not loving it the same way.)\\n\\n\\nAfter all, hard to say if I like it overall, but I´d rather say no then yes at the moment, cause I think I had more time being bored or frustrated than enjoying the game...\\n\\n\\nBUT:\\nI have 40h of gameplay as I write this rewiew. I think 40h should be enough to get a picture of a game. But maybe the game gets better if I keep playing? Maybe there are still a lot of interesting things to come I have not realised yet? If so, I am gonna change my rewiew to positive...\\nBut as it is now, I go with thumbs down so far, for making me play and play and play just for the hope it gets better...',\n",

Позже замечаешь что тоже самое касается флоры, фауны и техники (особенно фрегатов). С другой стороны исследовательская составляющая весьма неплохая и если бы не низкое разнообразие и тот факт что очень много чего прикрыто гриндингом, я бы поставил игре другую оценку.\\n\\nТаже самая поверхностная красивость с игровым процессом.

Тоже самое наблюдается с репутацией и миссиями. И если в начале все нормально, то чем дальше тем больше получается вечный и медленный гринд ради того чтобы делать все эффективней без резких качественных скачков, этот гринд не приносит чувства прогресса и следовательно удовольствия.

Even the story so far seems interesting and gives a player a sense of objective. The variety of items, ships, and even owning a freighter and a fleet of frigates gives the player a sense of the vast universe and power that can be achieved in the game.\\n\\nCons: There are tons of glitch's and bugs that occur while playing. Flying is not easy and combat with sentinels can be fun and annoying... Modding, Crafting, and resource gathering can become very overwhelming fast and having multiple bases in the same system seems to cause a glitch with the base computer quest... also if you go off course of the primary mission it seems you end up missing essential freebies that you end up buying by accident. Even short cut keys can be annoying at times since some are default attached to multiple actions in the same window. Lastly if your frigates get damaged on a mission you have to go land directly on that frigate, bring the right resources, and repair the individual damaged locations which could waste 10 minutes of your time running around the frigate to find and fix them... cool the first time... annoying every time after.\\n\\nTo go over all the minor problems and bugs in the game would be a novel and I am only 40 hours in now. They are not game ending bugs or issues but they certainly can cause you to reload a few times or regret building an entire base. For example finding out that certain industry level mining buildings glitch and do not allow to gather certain resources can ruin a base location you chose.

Lost 30 minutes of progress. \\n-Found an abandoned base filled with alien eggs, shot the eggs from a long distance away which triggered the Abominations to spawn, which walked around normally then fell through the ground and immediately teleported to me, killing me instantly. full inventory lost. \\n\\nThis game has a lot of potential for fun, especially with friends, but is such an enormously buggy game that I still cannot recommend. If you do decide to play it, I strongly recommend carrying around portable save points & use your ship every time you change station.

I didn't have the patience for either after researching online what each rewards you with. \\n\\nJump to 2019 with the Beyond update. Sure, the game is far more polished with more to collect, build, farm, and upgrade but the end experience is still the same: It takes an eternity to reach the center of the galaxy (the only true goal in the game) and the only reason to collect and upgrade is to... collect and upgrade. This game has no conclusion, no progressive difficulty, and a story so vague and paper thin that you'll lose interest in it within the first hour or two.\\n\\nThat's not to say the game isn't worth playing. I've had some legitimately memorable moments with this game (finding an amazing looking planet, running into another player randomly, traveling 20 minutes to a facility and back on foot because I thought I needed to all while surviving the elements), but once the veil falls and you realize that this game is essentially just loading one random set of 1-5 planets with the same space station and the same randomized ships and randomized multitools and randomized but re-occurring fauna and flora every time you warp then the game feels incredibly small and meaningless. \\n\\nFor this reason I cannot recommend this game.

Beyond just the bugs making this unplayable even when saving at all opportunities, such as the space anomaly drifting bug, the freighter phase-through bug, and more than I could mention about the construction bugs, there are many features implemented that are often just hostile to the player.\\n\\nBase-building is a chore at best and involves plodding through many dialogue prompts hoping that the next will actually bring progress rather than another pointless and unskippable non-sequitur, all while many crucial base components are missing from your blueprints, such as a door being required to enter a hab-pod, but if it is powered, it remains shut. This would not be a problem if the blueprint for a door switch weren't locked behind several branches of a tech tree. Another issue with bases arises from any plot that must be excavated, with the excavation tools not only being an absolute ball-ache to use, but with there also being the chance that your plot will once again be buried by the pointless terrain regeneration. Any desire to slightly modify the arrangement of base components requires deleting the component in question and hoping you have the inventory space to hold the refunded materials. All of this for the privilege of powering a storage pod that is also a chore to access without the ability to take with you anywhere like those that may be installed on a freighter.  The only tangible benefit from using a base is ground vehicle deployment, which requires a base on any planet you wish to use them on, which is a far cry from being a net positive result of the system.\\n\\nAll of this and more considered, I can honestly say I prefer the launch build of the game; it may have had problems, but that was from lack of content, not nigh-malign additions.\",\n",

I am trying to run this on a Valve Index, I have not tried other headsets with it.\\n\\nThis is a PSVR port that runs like shit, looks like shit and is unplayable as of mid August. If this changes I will change my review, but I am not holding my breath.\\n\\nEdit as of November: \\n\\nLiterally nothing has been fixed, its still a disaster. Don't bother with this.\",\n",

Twice in two days it has taken away my base setting it to guest) That means no additional building allowed)\\n3)Don't bother with the storage vault its huge with only a capacity for 5 items and it requires power to put things in and get things out.\\n\\nIt's come along way since it's initial release. These errors especially no.2 have been known to the community based on a recent search for awhile. Which means the either the developers don't care or don't know how to fix. Either way this makes part of the enjoyment of this game obsolete. Not sure how this breaks since the base computer has your name as the last person to edit. So I'm pretty sure a check that matches the current player name to the base last edited name to determine the players permission to edit should be simple logic to incorporate.

       " \"I really want to like this game a lot, and I have thought long and hard about whether to dip my toe in again, but can't bring myself to do so. The biggest problems for me, ones others have touched on, are too big to ignore. It's a really huge grind, and things feel tacked on just to keep you grinding. Dumb enemies without any personality, like the repetitive Sentinals, who are just there to annoy you at every turn (cos who doesn't like being harassed continuously while they try collecting and building) dampen any previous enthusiasm. I'd not mind as much if there was more variety of challenging enemies, which had various ways to deal with them.\\n\\nThe universe lacks personality, and in fact the biggest problem with it, is there's too much of everything.\\n\\nYOU SEE SOOOO MUCH. The emptiness of space is not depicted here, it's teeming with life, and so things become stale very quickly. If Hello had the nerve to hold things back, there might be genuine excitement when discoveries are made, out of the blue. Always knowing that there are things out there no-one has seen, waiting to be discovered, is what makes games like these special, it's why we enjoy them. But here, everything is thrown at you right from the off. Holding back is great, but only if you are giving us things that don't become wallpaper, and things that seem (even if they aren't really) unique. \\n\\nIt's a shame because there is a lot to love about the game, but in it's eagerness to give us lots of stuff, we only really get a small amount of genuine surprises, and a heck of a lot of chores to do.\\n\\nNote: Recently came back to this game to try the VR aspect. Turns out that the VR component is a jerky, stuttering, horrible mess on my Oculus Rift S/RTX 2070. I have good VR experiences generally, even if not always perfect, but here it was unplayable no matter what settings I changed. Oh don't forget to remember - every time you change a graphical setting, you have to restart the game, aagh! \\n\\nGreat potential.... maybe one day.\",\n",

There seems to be ZERO point to anything you do as all you will be doing is grinding to become more efficient, so you can grind some more. Add some travelling and you have NMS game play loop in its entirety, and it is all very easy, even when you first start out, because little to nothing will hinder your ability to do the only thing this game really has to offer, GRIND. The only \"challenge\" this game offers is managing your inventory. There is NO risk/reward factor, and the only time you ever really feel good about anything you have done in this game is when you build a sweet base, but that is basically ALL there is, unless you want to explore the overwhelming number of procedurally generated planets. Which I will say can be beautiful and cool looking from time to time, but that sense of beauty and coolness will wear off fast, then your back to the game play loop of grinding just to sight see, and grind some more. This game is entirely too based around being JUST a sandbox, and because of this, you have to make up your own fun too a degree iv never experienced in a game before. Even a game as similar and simple as Minecraft has challenge and reward. Why do non of these updates for NMS address the only real problem this game has suffered from since day 1? Without meaning, without risk, without reward, without challenge, this game is just not entertaining for most people.',\n",

Absolute nightmare to try and run wires.  Not only is it difficult to run the wires, (they dont snap right), but to power things requires your entire inventory of carbon.  I put in 200 Carbon and powered my base for 3 minutes and i cant turn the generator off and on.  Is cable management really a forced part of the game now?  Why do the plugs not snap right?  How did this make it past QA?\\n\\nThis is NOT fun.  Please allow us to disable the power systems in our own bases.  I am fine that other people may enjoy managing cables.  More power to them (hehe), but for the love of god, test your ideas with casual players too.  I'm sure there are some very dedicated people with amazing work on cable management.  I'm not one of them, and no, i'm not playing on creative.\\n\\nAt least Astroneer's cable system makes sense.  No Mans Sky just duct taped this into their game without considering how annoying it would be for people who dont enjoy working on cable management at data centers.\\n\\nVery disappointed.\",\n",

My pc is never fully utilized, but still drops frames and isn't stable. \\nThe virtual reality portion is even worse. This game in vr has the worst performance I have ever seen in a virtual reality game. It almost always runs at 45 fps in vr which hasn't changed or gotten any better. The game also looks horrible at this performance level even when running at such a bad fps level. Somehow I don't think that they are doing much in the way of optimization for amd hardware, so beware.  \\n\\nOverall, I find that this game is extremely fun, but is confusing at times. It feels like sometimes, objectives are hidden in a way like the developers don't want you to solve the problem you come across, even in the earliest stages. \\nI don't recommend this game, just because of preformance and MY experience, but the fact that the gameplay is fun and unique make it worth it to me\\n6/10\",\n",

That being said; I feel NMS continues to fail at living up to it's pre-launch marketing.Is it better than it was in 2016? Definitely. But that's a low bar. \\n\\nNMS is a mash up of serveral different genre's. It's an RPG, shooter, space exploring, walking simulator. It takes a little bit of gameplay elements from similar games and mashes them up in to a confusing jumble that amounts to a glorified treadmill of a game that doesn't produce as gratifying an experience as other games that focus on one of those elements.\\n\\nQuintillions of planets to explore? You bet and they're mostly re-skinned versions of each other. Awesome ships to buy, trade and customize? Yea and they effectively all do the same things. Want to discover and ride an winged mushroom-bear? You're going to have a hard time finding it among all the swimming cows that seem to inhabit every 5th planet.\\n\\nThe game takes a carrot-on-a-stock approach to make the gameplay loop compelling. Do a chore and unlock the next gadget that you think will finally take you off the treadmill. But that gizmo actually just makes the treadmill a little easier to run on. 100 hours in and you'll still find yourself grinding away and then you realize that if the grind ever stopped that there would be no point.\",\n",

There\\'s just no strong lead on what to do, it is made that way, but at least something would do other than the \"story line\" and following Atlas interfaces. You can do community stuff, but it is a bit underwhelming, being able to solo a hard quest requiring multiple players in under half an hour. The tutorial is ridiculous; to build a shed and to dig up tech modules is a great way to demonstrate some gameplay, but forcing the player to do it in order to continue with story missions makes it a slog.',\n",

       "  'review': \"How does this have so much positive feedback?? This game is still extremely buggy. And why can't you party with more than 4 players when it supports up to 32 per server on PC??\\n\\nNOTE: If you've never played before there is a LONG tutorial. You can't really play with friends very easily until you've all made it through enough of the tutorial to reach the anomaly space station.\\n\\nI tried to play with a group of friends over a weekend. We spent an entire Friday night and an entire Saturday trying to learn how to play the game and get to the anomaly, the entire time playing solo (for the most part). After several game crashes and buggy quests (one person could only complete quests playing as the host in their own game), we finally all made it to the anomaly and started a group quest. Upon starting the group quest and setting out on flight to the target planet, one friend's game crashed again and when he logged back in he couldn't join us. We tried to complete the quest 3-player but another's game crashed. With 2-players trying to complete the quest, one (somehow) ended up on a different step of the quest and couldn't proceed. The other was on the correct step (destroy 5 depots), but nothing he did would destroy the depots. He managed to destroy 2 out of 5 depots but the rest were just... invincible? All while being constantly bombarded by sentinels with 5 stars of threat and dying over and over.\\n\\nEven if you're a glutton for punishment and love overly complicated interfaces and tedious crafting, this game is still WAY more frustrating than it's worth IMO. Maybe if you play solo and only group with random strangers online? I don't know.\\n\\nVery disappointing. This game has so much potential. Flying from planet to planet, jumping star system, it all feels so amazing and looks breath-taking. I don't understand how the game is still so buggy and they still can't support larger party sizes. With the amount of bugs/issues we had, I would honestly say this game is near unplayable.\",\n",

(C) is odd because the shipwrecks seem to be identical on every planet I find one. \\n\\nI don't necessarily mind grinding as I play other games that have elements of it. I just don't find some things very germane to my enjoyment. Like hoofing it all over a planet to learn languages one word at a time. Or having basically 3-4 dialogue options for all NPCs. Again, maybe that unlocks after you grind a few hundred hours of running around the planet surfaces but I just can't get motivated to do that. Once you've gotten used to scanning the standard  half dozen things in range of your landing zone, it's just endless repetition. \\n\\nAll that said, I have to give them credit for improving a lot of the things that got them so much crap at release.

The PC version runs extremely smooth for me and i usually have no problems with it. Of course i have experienced about 2 crashes beforehand though, but the VR portion of this game is what brings it down for me. The VR experience in No Mans Sky lacks optimization to the extreme, which basically cuts the FPS in half. This ruins the play experience for me, thought im confident that the developers behind No Mans Sky can surely fix this sooner or later',\n",

       "  'review': 'Right now the game is extremely buggy, and i really mean extremely. Though i must say the game has alot of good content and is really addictive. So when or if they actually start caring about bug fixing this game it will be a thumb up. \\nBut at this very moment im pissed enough over all these bugs to write a proper freckin review on here.\\n\\nThe time between finding a new bug is only a few minutes. Some of these bugs are ofc depending on current system and not everyone will experience the exact same bugs that i do. But you will most likely just find other ones instead.\\nIve found new bugs every day ive been playing. Just to give you an idea of the severity ill list a few bugs:\\n\\n1. Game lagged like crazy until i found a way to manipulate the CPU core usage in one of the game files in the game folder.\\n2. A planet with one of my bases changed weather and sentinel status from neutral to aggressive all of a sudden. \\n3. A friend of mine had the game crash every time he died. Which you do alot first hour of play on survival if you are new. Way to steep learning curve for absolutely no reason btw...\\n4. Its common to fall/bounce through floors/walls/floating mountain structures. Both for you and the alien creatures. \\n5. Invisible walls appearing every now and then at places you know there shouldnt be one. Like for instance, when I save and log out when im in my freighter (its like your capital ship), I keep getting locked into rooms or finding invisible walls in the corridors. Several times ive had to rollback to last autosave. Autosave doesnt happen that very often, and in this case its kinda bad having to loose an hour or so of game time. \\n6. Able to sometimes duplicate items when moving items stacks between inventory and storage facilities. \\n7. Terrain manipulation sometimes working, sometimes not. Sometimes it resets instantly, sometimes it gets graphic bugs, sometimes instanly, sometimes you go away for a few minutes and come back to some really weirld looking spikes through the ground.\\n8. Bases does not always keep out weather effects and keep oxygen inside, eventhough they are complete with floor, walls and roof. \\n9. Your base does not tend to look the same to your multiplayer buddy. The game doesnt seem to sync properly with terrain/building parts and parts like trees and stones etc. \\n10. Sometimes after repairing your partly broken frigate (a ship that you can send out on missions for you) and get the \"repair complete\", you can still be able to find other broken parts for some reason. \\n11. Sometimes you cant move items from your storage to your inventory. Unless! You find the tiny pixel on the item icon that still works. Just imagine wanting to start a game or a program from the icon on your Desktop in windows. But it only works clicking the icon if you find 1 pixel on that whole icon. At first you think its completely broken but then you realise its only 99.9999% broken. Such a relief...\\n12. Short distance portals seems to work about 33% of every first time you try it and maybe only one way. After that it usually stops working completely. \\n13. Sometimes when close to an object while flying your space ship, the game seems to think you are stuck to the object and you start taking ship damage eventhugh you\\'re clearly not that close. \\n14. Sometimes you take random damage from or get stuck in ladders. \\n15. Hit boxes on stones or trees and stuff isnt always correct. So when trying to mine it, it doesnt work properly. \\n\\nI think i could go on forever.... I think you get the point. The game is more than broken at this moment and not worth the money. But with that said, I really think the game has potential and would be really fun without the bugs. The game could really be alot more informative though. There are ALOT of things that needs info or at least a hint. Some things you can google, some things you cant. \\n\\nIf i was rating the bugs id give it a 11/10. I have never played a game with this many major bugs at the same time. Especially not ~3,5 years after release. Its not even an early access title. But even if it was, this wouldnt have been sufficient tbh. \\nThe game in total gets a 2/10 with alot of potential points to come.',\n",

One of my friends convinced me to pick it up, and I\\'d seen a couple gameplay videos on it so I was like \"sure, fu.ck it.\" It has base building, exploration, space flight (in real time, mind, which is kinda weird but also kinda cool). Lots of cool toys to use. I was told that it was way better than it was at launch. It didn\\'t meet the high bar that\\'d been set.\\n\\nI get into the game (one of my friend\\'s already existing games), and spawn on a radioactive, caustic planet. If my friend hadn\\'t been there to provide the material I needed to constantly repair my suit, I\\'m sure I would have died quite a few times. However, my real bone to pick with, here, is the tutorial. It is LONG. It consists of finding your ship, finding materials, and running back and forth between ridiculously large distances just for the sake of repairing your ship and teaching you game mechanics.\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong with that?\" you may ask. Imagine you\\'re playing a different game. Let\\'s say Subnautica, instead. In the place of Subnautica\\'s short and sweet tooltips, necessary materials and such in the starting area, you have to swim all over the planet just to get your basic tools for survival (the scanner, the knife, etc). All of the dangerous fishes have already spawned in and you have to go into toxic areas, with limited protection. Imagine going through that. No bueno, yeah?',\n",

       "  'review': \"Look, I get it. This game used to be poo, now it's amazing with so many features. I've watched the Internet Historian video and its many permutations with people reacting to it. Great video, great game...\\n\\nBut I have to be honest here... it's kinda janky. Textures love to pop in and out of their blurry existence, and most importantly of all... the editable terrain loves, just LOVES, to revert back to its default state!\\n\\nYou're telling me, one of the game's CORE features of being able to reshape the world you're in, is hardcoded with a LIMIT? And if you go over that limit, well...\\n\\nMy base is in ruins, land forever sliding into it, no matter how much I try to manipulate the terrain, it keeps coming back.\\n\\nIt's heartbreaking.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Having played further, many of the game's features are unpolished and have some major level of jank. \\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n1. The UI's elements invisibly stacking, resulting in stuff like ship storage upgrading dialogue options suddenly causing the ship exchanging UI and dialogue to pop up, requiring a restart to refresh.\\n\\nThis stacking will cause problems when interacting with your freighter, and it has resulted in giving me one permanently uninteractible Fleet Command Room holding nonexistent frigates that CRASHES THE GAME whenever I interact with it.\\n\\n2. Freighter problems again. Apparently, if you summon your freighter on ANY system you deleted a Base/Base Computer in, the aforementioned Command Rooms will end up LOST and BLOCKED OFF. You end up having to fiddle with the Freighter room placements to be able to delete these lost rooms...\\n\\n3. Going into friends' bases when they're away is a horrendous experience. Stuff disappears and terrain resets (albeit temporarily) and the friend has to actually be present in the base if you want, oh let's say, 80-95% of the base to be there, depending on the base size.\\n\\n\\nOverall, while the team have been hard at work adding features and fixing bugs, they still have a long, LONG way to go when it comes to polishing and fully QA testing this diamond in the rough.\\n\\nAnd by rough, I mean REALLY rough.\\n\\n6/10\",\n",

Go get this material. Before you can harvest that material you need to repair your harvest tool. In order to do that, please run 800um over there to get that material. OK, repair tool. Now run back and gather that material. Oh, before you can find that material we need to craft a scanner, please run over that way and look for material to gather to build a scanner. OK, before we can build the scanner, please gather material to make a portable refinery. That material is on another planet, which requires we fix your ship, which requires another 45 different types of materials to be gathers. Opps, your gathering tool needs to be recharged, please gather material for that. Oh, your inventory is full? Drop something, and be very careful what it is, because your ship is out of fuel, and you will need to gather material to get to the place where you need to gather material to fix your material gathering tool. \\n\\nNope. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind grinding out in survival games, but this game is over the top in mind numbing, near zero progress, just gather to stay alive style gaming.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'While this game already has a lot of contents, obviously the team doesn\\'t want to spend time to polish. I had so many annoying experiences the first day I play it:\\n* Every time the game starts it asks me which graphics card it should use. There is no way to let it remember. There seems to be a problem on the Vulkan driver version, but no cue provided on how to fix it.  \\n* You can\\'t find option in main screen. You have to start a game to change the graphics settings and restart the game to apply.\\n* Seems to support controller, but some functions are not working. (Sometimes but not always, when it tells me to press R3, pressing R3 does nothing. I have to press the corresponding key on keyboard.)\\n* You can make a mark on the map while using scanner (F key), but a mark is not displayed if it\\'s outside the screen region. As a result it often gets lost just under your feet when you approach it.\\n* There seems to have a limit on how deep you can dig, but I happened to have a \"buried technology module\" below that limit. Not sure how I am supposed to get it.\\n\\nEdit:\\nAs I proceed, I found that the task system (the main story line) is also broken. There might be enough hints, but you have to watch everything carefully, because the \"Log\" tab in the game does not provide any useful information. Once the task asked me to find a place with a mark, but again the mark is so difficult to find in space (not showed if you are facing wrong direction, not showed if you are not in the right system).\\nFinally I managed to get a solar panel and container up and running and I feel it is so late. As sandbox games featured by exploring and collecting, Minecraft and Terraria both allow you to store spare items in chest since the first few minutes of playing. This one takes >10 hours.',\n",

The inventory mini game also aides in keeping you from striking out from your base or ship to explore the planets, which is a really cool gameplay mechanic.\\n\\n[b] * NPCs: [/b]  Flat and repetitive. Space stations all look the same. There\\'s a language mini game that does nothing except let you realize the NPCs are all saying the same lines, but just in different languages. There\\'s an effort to make the game LOOK like you\\'re not alone (NPC ships flying over on planets and taking off at space stations), but they serve no more purpose than the flaming angel animated GIFs on a late 90s Geocities website. \\n\\n[b] * Multiplayer: [/b] You can go to a hub where there are actual other players, but they\\'re just there to ignore each other and use the research stations. Outside of these hubs, you\\'re playing solo. I think you can pair up with a buddy and bring them to your instance of the game so you can \"enjoy\" the engaging deforestation sim together -- but I believe in Jesus.',\n",

Now the fact that we are 4 years in (NMS was released in 2016) and it is STILL in this state is why it gets a bad review. This game would be fine if it was marketed as an early access indie game however this game came on day one with a $60 price tag and was marketed as a launch title on the PS4, it didnt come to  xbox until much later. \\n\\nThis game has a TON of performance problems and has crashed on me far too many times to be acceptable. \\nI have a Ryzen 7 2700x CPU and an RX 5700 GPU, which is OVERKILL for this game.\\n\\nBuy this game on sale for $20 which is what it should be priced at, in no way is this a full $60 AAA game.

       "  'review': 'After 10 hours of playing the game now, and 10 hours at release, the game is still flat out not fun in survival , which is the most best mode. Everything is just refilling your life support, protection systems, fuel, constantly. And its not like you can avoid it, play smart to stay alive, its just constantly draining, ticking away pointlessly while you flail about with the stupid visor gimmick hunting down things that arent there, or are glitched into terrain, just so you can hold E and drag and drop it into an endless suck of material. Honestly, this game IS NOT worth your time, all the things you get to do simply cannot be worth the hours and hours of just holding left click and running around scanning utter garbage to try and find stuff that you use up in an instant and then have to go and find a heap more of. The physics are garbage. the forced 3rd person is atrocious. The camera spinning around and doings its own goddamn thing makes you seasick. The endless dragging and dropping and navigating the inventory is just unintuitive and frustrating. The ship flying physics are complete and utter nonsense, its like trying to ride a bicycle while completely slammed, and the steering is reversed and someone is constantly trying to push you over.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is the third time I’ve launched No Man’s Sky and attempted a play through. I love games where I can find a niche n a universe and go there away from real life and just live there for a time.  I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of a huge procedural universe. I keep coming back to NMS and I really want to live in their universe. Each time I come back it’s a heck of a lot better than the last time, but the is something missing. It just feels empty. \\n\\nHistory:  \\nThe first time I played was just after Beyond came out. Steam had a sale. A friend of mine and I bought the game and jumped in.  We spend maybe 5 hours fumbling with the clunky ui. We died like 10 times in the first 5 minutes. Then we figured out how to get sodium and oxygen and the challenge was over. After our first session my friend gave the game back and got a refund through Steam. I decided to keep the game with hopes that I might one day go back. \\n\\nThe second time I went in alone and was determined to endure beyond the clunkieness and find out if there was something I was missing beyond the learning curve. I worked through the story line, visited a few planets, started building my first base… Let me interject right here. Base building is my thing. I have over 4000 hours in Ark: Survival Evolved all of it on official pvp servers grinding out resources and building huge defensive functional bases. Life is Feudal, Haven and Hearth, Sub Nautica, even in Skyrim base building was my favorite part. But, the base building in NMS was so restrictive and the resource grinding so fumbly, bumbly, and boring I left halfway through my first wooden base and went back to Ark. \\n\\nPresent:\\nThird time is a charm? I still loved the idea of the game. While watching Internet Historian’s YouTube video on NMS, I laughed, I cried, (gaaaaay) and I decided to give NMS another go. Things have gotten significantly better. But….\\n\\n\\nThe good (Yes there is some good now): \\n1.\\t The options for base build are incredible. I was totally impressed with the number of options and the freedom. The system has been totally transformed for the good in comparison with my precious attempts at playing. It has so much potential. \\n2.\\tThe UI is less clunky and I am starting to understand the vision.\\n3.\\tIt’s huge.\\n4.\\tThe star ships, freighters, and frigates are super cool. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n1.\\tThere are no significant challenges. You die a few time in the first few minutes then it’s a handheld cake walk.\\n2.\\tThere is no reason to build a base. Maybe for elemental protection if you build on a hazardous planet. But, you can just jump back in your star ship and fly up to your freighter. \\n3.\\tInventory management is more than half of the game. Moving things from one inventory to another and back again over and over again. It’s not fun, it could easily be streamlined, but I think the developers are afraid if they removed the tedium of the inventory the game would have no challenges at all. \\n4.\\tThey’ve introduce a story to the game, but it’s an afterthought. It more like a long drawn out tutorial. The character are unmoving, the missions are boring, and I just going through the motions to get the upgrades. \\n5.\\tThe game feels dead despite all attempts to make it appear to be alive. For instance I’m standing on the surface of a planet that I just discovered naming all the plants and animals and every 5 minutes a squadron of faceless nameless NPC space ships fly over my head, Yet in the Anomaly, a space station where players from all over the enormous galaxy can go to meet and hang out, I can’t find anyone willing to talk to me. There aren’t even trolls! What, what, what!\\n6.\\tThere is no danger of loss, no planning necessary, or consequences for bad choices at all. For example in space there are asteroids everywhere. I mean everywhere. A constant cloud of asteroids filling the void between planets. But, these asteroids aren’t real. You can fly your ship right through them. You shoot them and get some resources. One of which is the fuel you need to travel between planets. So, there is no chance of running out of gas between planets. Let’s face it if you did run out of gas between planets you could always just reload a save game and start back at base. Or spend the twenty real time minuets it would take you to get to the next planet. But, those consequences are too dire hence the fog of ghost like asteroids. \\n7.\\tThe graphics are not good. The draw distance is horrible. I have a good rig. Walking across the surface of the planet the vegetation would pop in right in front of me and the animals some times wouldn’t register until I was already past them. Empty in front of me, turn around and oh! there are all the animals. \\n\\nIn conclusion: When I started writing this review my intention was to be mostly positive with a few critiques. But, when it came time to list the things I like about it I just couldn’t think of many and when I started writing about the things I didn’t the flood gate burst open. So, there you have it. If you already own NMS and you want to check out the new features go for it. The game is indistinguishable from the game I first played. If you don’t own it, I wouldn’t buy it. It’s a gigantic boring universe that I am leaving once again.',\n",

I have seen most updates for myself and if i did not get the chance to check all new features out, i read the patch notes. I will name two main problems the game has ALWAYS had and they were never even improved on, as far as i can see. Problem one: the game world feels lonely, empty and lifeless. NPC\\'s do not feel like NPC\\'s but furniture. Problem two: discoveries, exploration. Well there is nothing really to explore. Explore away, all you will see are different colors. Exploration is not rewarding in a gameplay sense as you will \"find\" nothing really. You will not come across unique NPC\\'s or quests. You will not \"unlock\" anything by discovering. So at the end of the day: you can build things  in a rather lonely setting in this game. With no real interaction or even combat really. I wouldn\\'t recommend it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I wanted to buy this game ever since it came out, but all of the controversy surrounding No Man\\'s Sky made me wait until more content was added. When the Beyond update was introduced I thought this is it, finally the game has enough content to be worth it. I bought on a Steam sale, download it and played it and, after 16 hours, I decided I had enough, at least until the next patch, because the game is bad.\\n\\nFirst the alien languages. Learning all of the words for all of the 3 main alien factions is fine, is a good mechanic, but it is so boringly implemented. You talk to aliens, find monoliths, complete missions for hours and you only learned 60 words, which might seem enough but you\\'ll still encountered aliens that use one of the words you have learned. Granted, it\\'s realistic but nonetheless boring.\\n\\nThe flying controls are good, they do their job, but once you get into some combat you\\'ll end up chasing the enemy through the whole system trying to aim at them. Games like Elite Dangerous and Everspace have controls that are suited for both combat and flying, so why can\\'t No Man\\'s Sky have some decent controls.\\n\\nIn my time playing I\\'ve visited 4 system, each controlled by a different faction, each with different planets that each have different weathers and resources and yet all of the hostile plants are the same. Either they are the \"fungus\" that releases toxins, the tentacle that hits you, the plant that inflates and explodes releasing toxins or the plants that bite you. But, while for the hostile plants is more noticeable, some rocks also share the same structure, like the pillars that contain cobalt.\\n\\nThe game run poorly, with lots of frame drops. I\\'ve played more recent more demanding games than No Man\\'s Sky and they run better. The game needs to be optimized, badly. \\n\\nFinally the bugs. In those 16 hours objects would fall through the floor, I wouldn\\'t be able to retrieve the resources that I stored on my containers, the roamer would become invisible every time I use one of those antenas that charts the maps on planets, monoliths and containers sometimes spawn floating in mid air, Biological Horrors would get stuck running in circles, sometimes I take fall damage when falling from a high place and sometimes I don\\'t, once I teleported from one planet to another and when I checked my inventory it show me the inventory for the roamer and never went away until I restarted the game, one time the game made me do a mission twice for no apparent reason.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but the truth is that No Man\\'s Sky is not ready to be played. With the bugs, the poor performance and the odd design choices the game feels more like it is in open beta, not ready for prime time yet. Wait for a big sale or more updates when they fix the problems before buying.\\n\\nP.S.: I know my english sucks, but it is my second language and I\\'m trying to improve it, that\\'s why I wrote this \"review\" on english.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game has potential, but it still has to be polished.\\n\\nTHE EXPERIENCE\\nI appreciate how far the game has come since launch. The game has had several large updates. The game has some resemblance to the feel of Subnautica, which made me hopeful. The soundtrack is mostly uninteresting and bland. It is hard to get immersed and in to the mood. \\n\\nUnlike in subnautica, here the story is more or less mandatory for you to get the technology to make real progress. It\\'s unfortunate, because it means that, initially there is one \"right way\" to play this \"sandbox\" game. For me so far, the story has only gotten in the way. It might be forgiven, but the story it\\'s self is not particularly interesting. I\\'d rather do my exploring in peace and after I\\'m more or less content, I\\'d go looking for the story and quests.\\n\\nThe game seems to have content, but I\\'m yet to find out, for how long will it entertain (39 hours played). It may last yet, as the game offers content at a very slow pace. The enjoyment per hour leaves something to be desired.\\n\\nThe start was slow and un-intuitive. The building menus were overwhelming. I\\'ve gotten mostly used to it, but the UI is a bit complicated at times, or at least unconventional. UI seems to be optimized for a controller, not keyboard. \\n\\nThe idea of \"learning\" alien languages is sort of interesting, but it\\'s slow and after almost 40 hours in, it has mostly lost its charm. I still don\\'t have nearly a full vocabulary of even the first language. You learn one word at a time and the word is never the one you need for context. I found it amusing that the alien language had words for \"a\" and \"the\", and both had to be learned separately. I would have much rather learn the words for \"trade\", \"price\" and \"kill\". \\n\\nWhen I first found a new crashed shipwreck I was exited to claim it. I didn\\'t have the materials or technology to completely fix it, but I was exited to work towards fixing the ship and making her fly. It would have been a fun and meaningful goal at just the right time. Imagine my disappointment when I come back with the first set of supplies and find the ship gone! Despawned! The first major bit of interesting gameplay content stolen from me. \\n\\nAfter searching the forums, it is currently a \"feature\" of the game. I\\'m supposed to not touch anything until I can fix the ship enough to make her fly. I wish I\\'d known! The \\n\\nIt turns out that only the flying bits (engines and drives) need to be fixed to enable takeoff. The rest effect only cargo space.\\n\\nBUGS\\nI\\'ve had some crashes and game refusing to start after. Some inventory gets stuck and requires clicking on the edges to free. Sometimes NPCs walk through walls or eachother. My base has despawned and needed reloading the planet (teleport out and back). There are several glitches that enable infinite cash or materials.\\n\\nGRAPHICS\\nGraphics look nice. I like how the rings of ringed planets are visible from the surface and the planets have day and night cycle, but you can always fly on to the opposite side, where the time of day is different. There are nice weather effects, on planets that have weather to speak of. Overhead clouds cast shadows on the ground.\\n\\nIt required some tinkering to get running \"well\" (almost 60 fps avg (50-75 fps)) on my R5 1600 and RX580 at 1440p. V-Sync was on by default. Disabling it helped a lot. I have FreeSync anyway. Also I had to disable HBAO. The minimum requirements give a wrong impression. A low end machine may run this, but it will not look like anyting modern.\\n\\nVERDICT\\nI\\'m on the fence with this one. There obviously is tons of stuff in the game, but the experience is lacking. There are too many bugs or unpolished features. I won\\'t say you shouldn\\'t buy this. I\\'m saying, you should know this if you buy the game. I didn\\'t pay the full price, thank God. I got it on sale for 27-ish €. I will continue playing and hoping my review is adventually proven wrong.\\n\\nI sincerely hope the devs polish the game. It\\'s not finished yet, but it may become great.\\n\\nThis game should be really be tagged \"Early Access\".',\n",

I, however, have no problem admitting it: I was fleeced.\\n\\nUnfortunately for everyone, the game is still very boring. No amount of uninspired base building or space combat can fix the cluttered UI, awful keyboard and mouse controls, and sheer technical failure.

And, to top it all off, it\\'s still a full-priced game! More than THREE YEARS after the most inauspicious launch of all time, and this studio still thinks the game is worth $60!

Here I will outline why and maybe it helps someone make a decision.\\n\\nThe highest gameplay level (the thing you do on a moment-to-moment basis) is very boring. You do 3 things:\\n1. Walk around and collect resources by clicking on things\\n2. Fly on your spaceship.\\n3. navigate menus and menus and more menus\\n\\nApart for item 3, writing it out like this makes it sound promising, but the implementation falls flat. The first two items are trivial. Walking around is understandably trivial but flying a spaceship? that's such a wasted opportunity to introduce interesting gameplay mechanics and challenges. Unfortunately it's the most trivial aspect of the game. You point and the ship goes. Zero regards for physics, which I understand is a matter of opinion, but at least that would add challenge to the game. Acquiring orbit, matching velocities, docking, landing etc. These things are rewarding to master, add a dose of challenge and real risk, which in turn would validate resource gathering for repairing or improving maneuverability. These things could be acquired without realism too, but it needs to be much more than point and go.\\n\\nAs is, the only motivation given by direct gameplay to gather resources is to... gather more resources. The storyline tries to motivate that by giving you a trail to follow. Signals left behind by someone or something. Interesting, but that doesn't hold on its own.\\n\\nThe third item, menu navigation, needs to be included in such a list because there is so much of it! And it's clumsy as hell too. It's just such a boring thing to be doing in a game that advertises itself as a space exploration game.\\n\\nAnd without challenge in flying, the exploration game mode is a hard sell too. It's a glorified atlas of a procedural universe. For that purpose one could do better with Space Engine, in my opinion.\\n\\nNone of this makes the game inherently bad, just not for me. If you are the kind of person who enjoys navigating menus to craft things that can be used to craft more things, give NMS a chance. I don't mean it sarcastically, it just sounds like it because I really don't like doing these things lol\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I have no idea where to start. I really wanted to like this game. I love a good survival base builder and have given No Man's Sky a good while since release to iron out the bugs and game play issues. At least so I thought.\\n\\nEverything about this game feels unpolished and unfinished. The ship flight is clunky and almost feels like a mini-game, the story mode is very poorly written and often leaves you questioning exactly what it is you're supposed to be doing. The space navigation system is poorly implemented and a chore to use. The resource gathering is riddled with bugs and feels little more than a grind. The 'unique worlds and creatures' feel repetitive and uninspiring. There was almost nothing about this game that I found enjoyable, and I usually love this kind of title.\\n\\nSeveral specific issues I personally encountered that were particularly annoying to me were the following:\\n\\n- when you mine a resource it almost always claims to still be present and doesn't disappear from the scanner HUD. I've read several post of people claiming that it's because you have to remove every single part of the resource from the ground first (a terrible design choice in the first place if that was the case) but even after meticulously removing what I'm mining I always perform a local scan to discover that the game still thinks a little bit of resource remains in thin air (and this continues after attempting to mine the thin air every way possible). This is effectively game breaking for a base building and resource gathering game.\\n\\n- more than once when mining through terrain to get to a location (a handy way to travel on worlds with environmental hazards) I've had the tunnel around me vanish resulting in me falling to my death. This game is supposed to be several years into release ... not in alpha.\\n\\n- Creatures or hazardous plants being able to still kill me through terrain if I am in a tunnel.\\n\\n- Very roughly 1 in 4 times when I'm attempting to travel to find resources using the visor scanner, I get to the site to discover it's just a lump in the ground with no actual resource there.\\n\\nI honestly can't see how this game has a single positive review. There are plenty of base building survival games out there and almost all of them are better than this one ...\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I got this game on sale for $30, and even at that price I can't suggest this game. I heard this game got a nice revival with updates for co-op and more, but the game still feels so empty. Let's address what I hated so much.\\n\\nCo-op\\n\\nEven though you're in co-op, you both still have the same exact missions you each individually have to do. You can't work together to complete the objective. Wanna build a base with your friend? Nope. The base terminal makes you claim ownership of land and though you can build with your friend, it's quite limited. Why is co-op in the game if nothing you do together matters?\\n\\nThe Grind\\n\\nThis entire game is just a massive grind of doing the same thing over and over and over. Mine. Turn that material into something. Complete your objective. Repeat. Oh and don't forget that you must CONSTANTLY be recharging things in your inventory. Your mining laser constantly needs fuel, as does your hazard protection, your life support, and your ship. You may enjoy the quests but you'll be grinding just to refuel those things throughout the whole playthrough. You also barely have any inventory space and it's extremely expensive to upgrade.\\n\\nNothing about this game was good other than the visuals being nice. Decent game for some nice screenshots. Unfortunately, I can't suggest this game unless it's dirt cheap.\",\n",

It’s poorly optimized for latest video card rendering due to json coding dependency. \\n[*]Game will never be truly multiplayer\\n[*]VR HTC Pro Vive/Oculus both were glitchy and bad rendering and had to tweak out ini files (not user friendly for common users). And yes, I keep my rig with the latest hardware\\n[*]End game story line didn’t cause a wow factor\\n[*]There’s a mod aka yes….hack, that enables anything (including pre-ordered rewards), to be spawned in which carries over to coop gameplay. This should be separated! This isn’t Minecraft people, coop should equal all players starting equally.\\n[*]Planet(s) are pretty much the same materials to mine, just different cosmetic every 5-10 planets (no true uniqueness to really want to explore for that special reward grinding for hours to get the warp materials!)\\n[*]You can easily get all the Steam Achievements using mods\\n[/list]\\n\\n[u]Pros:[/u]\\n[*]It runs smooth on PC version and steam custom controller support configuration. \\n[*]Fun transitions between planet level to space, space stations etc. \\n[*]Flying is smooth using a controller (not fun in VR Vive/Oculus controllers and causes nausea)\\n[*]Base building does snap into place when you need it. Base building in general is well done\\n[*]If playing without mods, you can enjoy having NPCs to help you unlock new recipes for crafting or materials to advance that you hire and work at your main base.\\n[*]Mod supportive to keep the game fresh\\n[*]Coop but very buggy\\n[*]Developers are keeping patches aka new content added without paying extra $$$ for a stupid a$$ DLC micro release!\\n[/list]\",\n",

Can't mine in tunnels/caves without randomly teleporting outside above ground (lost count of how many times this happened). Can't edit terrains nearly at all - every change to the terrain respawns and undoes your work. Our entire base then also randomly despawned and we lost all of our progress. Enemies can hit you through the ground, so taking cover or hiding in a cave is pointless. We tried for hours to enjoy this game but with all of that going on, we're done. Hopefully your experience is better.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I heard a lot about how this game had gotten \"good\" after a lot of post-launch updates. While I am sure that the main game has been improved, I personally find the beginning of the game so unbearable tedious that I am not interested in the rest of the game. The entire UI is a mess on PC and what makes it worse is that you need to constantly interact with the UI because you have a bunch of \"survival\" meters to top up every 5 minutes. Instead of food and water, though, it\\'s \"life support\" and \"environmental protection\". I don\\'t see how this was thought to be necessary at all. It simply means that instead of running or walking anywhere, you have to crawl around with your mining laser and pick up carbon and oxygen just so you don\\'t die. Perhaps after you get a lot of character upgrades then the game becomes bearable, but as it is right now I wouldn\\'t bother giving it a try.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I knew this game flopped on release, so decided to give it a few years and wait for a sale. Well I finally got it for $25 and can\\'t even believe that it\\'s not even worth this much. The game kills you off within the first minute playing on the easiest difficulty, so you can\\'t even figure out any part of the game. I also looked at the keybindings, and there are 6 different menus within the keybinding screen full of keybinds that look almost the same, yet can\\'t figure out because there\\'s no time to figure them out when the game kills you within the first minute.  There is also a cinematic thing when you start a new world that prevents you from skipping, moving your view, or moving your character, but at the same time still lets the environment deal damage to you, so you just have to sit there and watch yourself die while the camera pans from the sky to the ground for no apparent reason. Oh and the UI is extremely unintuitive, instead of having functions in the game tied to things you can keybind, you have to go through a \"quick menu\" which is not at all quick for simple things like changing from first person to third person that I only found on accident after my 4th death.',\n",

Of course, it wasn't even close to being as good as advertised, it lacked content, had performance issues etc. However, back then I saw great potential and I found myself playing it for many hours until I ran out of things to do. After so much time I decided to revisit the game. It is the exactly the same as before. Graphics got updated, it runs smoother but new graphical issues (such as the textures loading when you are on top of them due to Vulkan, which ruins everything) that did not exist back then, the world still being empty (just as it used to be) and the micromanaging being worse than it was back then makes it a STAY AWAY for me (unless you find it at 60%+ sale and ya got some money to burn)\",\n",

       "  'review': 'As it was 50% off and due to have been improved significantly since launch, I finally got this game. I was intrigued by the idea of an endless procedurally generated universe, among other things.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n- Nice crafting and base-building mechanics\\n- Basically impossible to get stuck without enough materials to continue\\n- The story and how it is presented\\n- Some planet diversity\\n- Awesome graphics\\n\\nThe bad:\\n- Planetary navigation. If you can procedurally generate a planet with points of interest, it must be possible to generate a map as well. That would also help with exploration.\\n- In-system navigation. The only help is the in-ship display, which does an incredibly poor job of telling you where you are and where you need to go.\\n- Galaxy navigation. It is atrocious, awful, terrible. There is simply no way to sugarcoat it. Please look at some 4X games (e.g., Stellaris) to see how it can be done properly.\\n- Base building vs. exploration: This game does not seem to be able to make up its mind if it wants to be an exploration game (the storyline mostly indicates that) or a base building game (which a lot of missions indicate). I could, of course, build bases all over the galaxy, but to what end?\\n- Space combat. Ugh. I almost got nauseous trying to shoot down planes. It may be realistic-ish, but it is bad.\\n- The lack of technology improvements. Scanning takes the same amount of time in the beginning as it takes in the end. Inter-planetary travel hardly improves.\\n- Language learning. I see almost no difference between the original translator, and the upgraded version. I am not even sure what the translator does, as I still need to learn the language one word at a time.\\n- The repetitiveness of everything. After having seen 20 planets, I had mostly seen it all. I am scanning the same plants and minerals over and over again, because somehow they are a little different than the same-looking ones from the previous planet. I keep shooting asteroids because fuel efficiency improvements are meh. I keep mining ferrite dust, carbon, etc., because my warp cell only lasts 5 jumps. I keep walking endlessly to mine stuff because somehow my spacecraft cannot show me where the deposits are on the planet. And so on.\\n\\nThe ugly:\\n- Cut scenes. Endless cut scenes. It is cute the first 2-3 times, but becomes very tedious afterwards.\\n- Orientation. Due to the poor navigation interface, it is very difficult to have any idea of where you are and/or where you are going.\\n- Lack of storage space. There are some improvements here, but it still gets me. Upgrades can only be bought one at a time, once per space station. And quickly become crazy expensive.\\n- Endless grinding. If you are the sort of person who enjoys grinding for resources, good for you. If not, this may not be the game for you. Maybe the base building helps here to some extent, but if so, it was unclear to me.',\n",

It is actually harder to come back and play after giving it a break. And what happened to the controls? WHY MESS WITH THE CONTROLS. Yes you can remap them, but they are so convoluted (buttons do not do what makes sense or what the icons say they should) (hold left bumper to select instead of x?). Maybe I will get bored enough to sit down and rebind them to a reasonable config one day but it's not work the time as of now.\",\n",

And the tutorial portion of the game was very difficult to navigate. It was work, and I still don't understand it.

       "  'review': \"Yes, it has been updated. Yes, it is beautiful. No, it isn't fun. There's little to no story; the main motivation of the game is silly; there's no cool sci fi aspects; the missions are all the same; the worlds are almost the same (every world has almost the same aspects but with different colors and names); the combat is silly.\\n\\nThe only challenge I encountered so far was having enough patience for walking from one insignificant landmark to the next or patience for gathering resources that are always available.\\n\\nThe only challenge is if you have time to throw away with this game. You don't have to think nor have any kind of skill. I bought it for playing with my friend who lives abroad. We wanted to make a base together since we can't see each other irl. Well, only one player can own a base and if that player isn't online, the base vanishes. It isn't true multiplayer, it is single player alongside one another.\\n\\nNevertheless it has a nice procedual experience and neat visuals. That's all. I wish I could refund this game, but I've spent 8 hours walking on silly fetch missions and Steam won't give my money back. It still isn't worth the money and time.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I tried. I really tried to like this game. Flying in and out planets and system seamlessly sounded amazing and is done amazing in many ways, but the lack of reason to play and the variety of planet content was and still is a problem. There are so many bugs and inconsistent behaviours that takes away all the efforts from the developers to fix this game:\\n\\n- There is no sense of loss in this game. You can build and build and destroy all life that is current rendered in your current planet that it causes no problem. There is no penalty for killing fauna or harvesting flora too much. You go out to space, in to the planet, and everything is there again.\\n\\n- Following the same idea, when you clean up an area to build your base (like removing small rocks and plants), if you go out to space and return it will be filled with all those rocks and plants you just removed.\\n\\n- The dialog and story is pathetic. It\\'s not just bad, it is filled with generic meaningless dialog with no voice-over and with no sense at all. It is slow, you have to smash buttons to fast forward and sometimes you have to take actions that makes no difference in the end, the NPC will behave the same way and the outcome of a dialog is always the same.\\n\\n- It is way too repetitive. Quests are always about: Killing life in any planet, with no reason at all; Delivering item X from A to B, with some generic space pirates in your way; Scan mineral/plants, again, with no reason at all, with no specification about it. The game must have twenty types of planets yet it quests are not really engaging enough; Destroy supply depots that have either a walker or some sentinels.\\n\\n- There is no ship customization. You will have to patiently watch random ships landing and taking off from a space station until find something you like. Races, sectors or planets have no influence about what you will find.\\n\\n- Inventory management is poorly made. Once you put your items from inventory to storage, you can\\'t get a fraction of it, you can split in packs, you either get all or none. That\\'s one of the basic principles of stacking items.\\n\\n- You can buy blueprints for new buildings and base parts with an item called \"salvaged data\", but if you follow one of the main quest lines you will have to build and hire specialists that will research most of the machines available to buy with salvaged data.\\n\\n- There is no automation at all. You explore a planet, but you have to manually check and refuel some machines that, for whatever reason, can\\'t be connected to your power grid.\\n\\nThey are still updating it and adding content that should have been released ages ago. In the current state, it doesn\\'t worth the full price. Get it only in a major discount.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Played the game at launch, played through a few updates, and played with the most recent changes. The game has come a long way since inception, but one thing has stuck with it throughout. Some may call it \"an immersive sim\", but I call it \"slow and tedious\".\\n\\nSeemingly every action in the game is tied to a limit, a timer, or just slow interface. You don\\'t click on anything, you hold your button down for a second. You can\\'t specify a stack, you have to slowly change the stack by keeping a button pressed down. You can\\'t just mine, you have to avoid overheating and refill your batteries with plentiful resources. Traders in stations can\\'t be on the same level as you land, they have to be up on a ledge and out in the distance. You can\\'t grab all of items from one category to move between your ship and your backpack, you have to move each stack of 5-10 individually. You can\\'t simply scan a surface, you have to get a meaningless boot up message first before you get your options. You can research some upgrades in a small research tech you can place, but if you want more options you have to go into your spaceship, go into space, summon a station, fly in, sit through the landing/docking animation, run in to find the research vendor and only then are you allowed to spend your research points on something you wanted.\\n\\nAnd this is just the basic gameplay before you start getting into making money, upgrading your tools, buying spaceships, etc.\\n\\nNone of these are particularly egregious, but the entire game feels like moving with weights on. Everything drags and chips away at your patience bit by bit.\\n\\nIf you can stomach that and enjoy sandbox games, you can have fun with this game. Personally, I find it too tedious to enjoy it long-term.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is ok. I pre ordered it and played it a bit when it was first released. Was sorely disappointed, so I waited and after the synthesis update decided to give it another try. I would consider it in an early access state and definitely NOT worth $60! It still has so many issues. Some things have improved, but no much in my opinion. They added and changed a few things that help, but the same issues I dealt with before still exist. \\n\\nSo many things don\\'t work properly and the mission line needs some serious work. Mostly the advocates of this game focus on the \"infinite universe to explore\". Sounds neat, but after you visit a dozen or so planets you realize its just different combinations of the same 20 to 30 things. Planets and creatures mostly look and seem so similar that it becomes the same thing, over and over again. This has been tried to be hidden or distracted from by choosing different sounding names for the same things. All frozen planets are cold, snowy, icy places, but they can be called frost, frozen, glacier, freezing etc. Different names for the same thing. Its the same with all the planet types. Hot are called boiling or fiery or blazing. Toxic are called poisonous, or fungal etc. Every once in a while you might come across a planet or animal that surprises you, but not very often.  \\n\\nAside from the eventual boredom of the same things over and over again, there are a lot of issues with the set up of the missions. Specifically the order they force you to follow. For instance, the first thing you are required to build is a base computer which is under the portable menu, but once you establish your base, you can NEVER move it. Which means later, after you are able to build structures, you can\\'t put the stupid thing inside. Then, quite a long way down the road, after multiple missions doing other things, you are given an electromatic generator. Immediately finding out that the spot you chose for your base isn\\'t going to work because you aren\\'t on a hotspot, because you didn\\'t know about hotspots until now. So, you can either rely explicitly on solar power or move your entire base, start from scratch and rebuild. Solar power was frustrating for me as the panels don\\'t exactly indicate which direction they will face until after they are placed and you can\\'t pick them back up again. You end up being forced to move your base. The order of the missions should be different. A MOVEABLE base computer, followed by generators. Then, it should be exocraft third. Instead, you have mission after mission and upgrades and technology modules that require tons, literal tons of materials. Meaning you either have to hoof it all around the damn planet, or waste loads of fuel on your starship that only gets 4 lift offs flying from deposit to deposit. You don\\'t get the exocraft that is EXTREMELY helpful in traversing a planet on the ground and gathering materials until last. It is the last terminal you get which SUCKS! By then, you almost don\\'t need it! These are only a few of the problems I have found with the missions and their nonsensical order of progression.  There are tons more and they make game play extremely frustrating and unrewarding. You end up feeling cheated because you were forced to do things \"the hard way\" and grind like crazy only to find out that if things were just re ordered properly it would have made advancing a fun and rewarding experience. \\n\\nThen there are the CONSTANT bugs and weird things that happen. I have had knowledge stones suddenly morph into a crystal. Buildable recipes completely disappear, yet when I go to buy them, it says I already own them. Yet it won\\'t let me build them. Sometimes when I enter the build menu seemingly EVERY advanced item will be unlocked, I will even build some, then a minute later, none of them are available. This happens CONSTANTLY.\\nYou can\\'t walk through doorways, you have to jump. You can\\'t walk onto floors, you have to jump. Doors stay open when they are powered, making it impossible to put auto switches on them because they will close the door when you approach which is beyond stupid. \\nSometimes it doesn\\'t register that I am indoors even when I am and I have to refill my damn hazard charge or go sit in my ship to be safe from a storm. \\n\\nMultiplayer is all but useless. You can\\'t share the same storage. Can\\'t utilize the same base computer. It forces the other players that join your game to go build their own base to advance in their missions, which means you are just playing on your own anyway. The only benefit is that you can help others fight sentinels and pirates and you can trade items, but the whole thing is cumbersome and decidedly separate. \\n\\nBecause it will suddenly unlock items that shouldn\\'t be unlocked for you and then taking them away, it ends up corrupting your saves and the game gets CTD\\'S until you go in and clear certain files. It took several times, but I linked quite a few of these crashes to the game unlocking items that I shouldn\\'t have then taking them away. Other times I can\\'t figure out why it is crashing. \\n\\nI have also spent nanites on technology or recipes only to have them relocked after I save and quit. The next time I am on, all my nanites are still spent, but I have to re buy the damn things. It strangely seems to save only some things and not others. I found a crashed ship, claimed it, and got half of the things fixed on it. Only to log in the next day and it acted as if I had never claimed it. I had to re claim it and begin fixing it again. grinding for materials and jumping from solar system to solar system to look for parts or materials that I couldn\\'t build/find, only for it to do it again! I wasted nearly six hours and tons of materials trying to fix the damn ship 3 times before giving up. \\n\\nI will always hit the save point before exiting, and even though I return at the exact spot, a lot. A LOT of things I had done in the previous session won\\'t be there. Materials I gathered, certain items I made won\\'t be in my inventory. Machinery I built won\\'t be there etc. \\n\\nI have done everything I can on my end to make sure this stupid game runs smooth. I have all my drivers up to date, have verified files, uninstalled and reinstalled etc. This game is the issue. I have payed for over 100 hours and these things are CONSISTENT.\\n\\nNow, all that being said. It is still playable, as long as you can deal with the frustrations, but as I stated in the beginning, it is definitely in an early access state in my experience. It doesn\\'t run smooth, or feel fun. Its boring grinding and frustratingly repeating a lot of lost progress. Not to mention the rediculous cost of EVERYTHING. I haven\\'t even begun trying to earn enough to buy another ship, and frankly, I am just about burned out. I honestly don\\'t see how anyone can stick to playing this game continuously. \\n\\nI don\\'t recommend this. Wait another year or two and see if it improves. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"Went well for the first 15 hours.  Then I decided to do some heavy asteroid mining and everything went to crap.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to spend more than 10-15 minutes at a time mining asteroids without the game locking up and crashing on you.  If you mine an entire large asteroid there is a very good chance it will cause the game to crash on the last chunk.  Mining asteroids is the best way to make a large amount of credits in the early game and it crashes on every attempt.  It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to fly to a planet or a station to save our progress but for some reason we do which means we lose all our progress when the game crashes.  5x back to back this has happened to me now and cost me 2hrs of progress overall.  I played this game when it first came out on another platform and it's sad to see that years later we STILL can't go into space without having to worry about a crash and lost progress.  I give it a 5/10 until they finally fix the issues with the main theme of their game.\",\n",

The game has a ton of glitches, which the creators are diligent about fixing, but the worlds are so massive, there is always going to be glitches. I have logged appx 150 hours in the game hoping the quests would be more in depth, but nah. If you like free play and collecting stuff and having a huge number of coins, this game is for you.

       "  'review': \"There may be some issues, but this is the closest to alien exploration you can get. Maybe some day they can improve their algorithm to make for more custom planets and changing the colors of your starship. The game can eventually get dull after a while, but the exploration makes the game fun. Fixing those issues might keep players around. \\n\\nChanging the description for aliens and plants would be great too. The algorithm just shoves random and repetitive blurbs together depending on the lifeform, so being able to personalize that more might make players more into the game and scanning things. As for minerals, many have the same properties, so maybe making them scan-able and re-nameable once would be good. Also letting players know how many types of minerals, flora and fauna are on a planet would be nice too, so they know when they've 100% a planet or moon. As well as having planets with 'super life' (i.e. planets with a large sum of lifeforms, something like 50 fauna and 100 flora, and massive creatures) would be pretty neat as well. Finding fauna is one of the most fun aspects of No Mans Sky, after all.\\n\\nThe addition of dwarf planets and even rouge planets would be neat. especially if the rouges were only in the system for X amount of time, and without a base they would be unreachable practically forever, as they are only passing through the system. You could have them in various states, depending on how long they were away from their home star for, or the content of their atmosphere. For example, dense nitrogen atmospheres hold in heat really well, allowing for liquid water on its surface. If the planet brought along a moon or two, the tidal pressure exerted would help distribute heat around the planet, keeping liquid water on its surface.\\n\\nMaking more reasons to return to old systems and bases would be great too. As it stands, once you leave a system why go back? And your base is practically gone. Maybe when setting up the base computer you could have an option to place a pre-existing base for X amount of materials (like one third to half worth the initial cost of the build) and then you could continue to add on and re-save that build, as well as have multiple builds saved at a time. When placing the base, you could go into builder mode automatically, and an outline shows up with little AI scanners going around, and you can more easily place the base were you'd like. Then you could get your materials and return to the hologram outline and press a key to add them until the materials have been met and the base is built. Connecting parts of a base together could be as simple as a connector mode in the building option, and much like hooking up electricity in the game, you'd connect parts of your build together to be saved as your base.\\n\\nThose are just a few of the ideas to improve this game that I've had while playing. Overall, a very fun game to play.\\n\\nwould also love to add that the weekly quicksilver missions are not even possible to complete anymore. Straight up doesn't let me transfer the items to the mission even though i have all the  items. straight up bs.\",\n",

Stopped playing when they still had bugs in awakenings that caused npc's dialogue to break at the space station.\\n\\nThe biggest problems I think that plague it since the beginning is locking core gameplay mechanics behind required story missions in an open world environment. You basically have to do what the game wants you to do to unlock basic basebuilding features. It is an open world but you are punished in your capacity to create and use basic gameplay mechanics for not doing their fetch quest story missions. This in my opinion creates a lackluster linear experience. There's always creative I guess, for those that have no desire for any actual game content. Then again there is always minecraft for that.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I waited 3 years post release to get the game.  Hearing that they now allowed multiplayer and base building hooked me in.  Well.  After a hundred or so hours of play, I'm shelving the game for now and going to wait.  I cannot recommend this as a buy it now title.  It is better than it was, but it still isn't much of a game.  It is in a technical brilliant game and as a developer myself I can appreciate the proceedural generation work.\\n\\n The story is told through overly cryptic, short convo's without logical dialog branches.  Multiplayer only allows you to really be around your friends.  Very little reason to actually do anything in multiplayer.  Base building is ultimately pointless and unnecessary (all you need it for is processing higher tier ore and farming plants - which you can do elsewhere in the game).   \\n Base building especially around other people is buggy, putting another problem with actually doing this for multiplayer reasons.  \\n\\nAfter a while planets become very much the same thing arranged in different order.  Combat is not very challenging 90% of the time and you are almost never in any real danger (you don't have to defend your base).  \\n\\nYou can only have one frieghter in a system making multiplayer grouping silly.  And things are gererally easy to acquire if not just handed to you for little or no effort.  \\n\\nIt can be a better game, but it needs to be a game first.\",\n",

How do I know well I make games so why would you not want free updates to keep players coming. But how are you going to have an update that crashes every time you go through the portal that is needed to do missions. Its time wasting and frustrating due to the fact it cancels all progress in that mission and restart from square one. How does this make me want to play more. Once you've traveled so much the only thing to do is the Nexus missions but when you cant even come back to collect cuz the game has an unexpected error at the same spot 5 times.

       "  'review': 'This game is terrible.\\n\\nImagine if you took all the bad parts of Destiny, all the tedious chore-like grinding from Minecraft/Subnautica/etc., and then add the worst flightsim you\\'ve ever played. That\\'s No Man\\'s Sky. Here are a few highlights of why this is such a terrible game.\\n\\nWill they overwhelm you with options, upgrades, and countless types of materials? Yes. So if that\\'s your thing, go for it. But it feels hallow. Unlike subnautica where there\\'s a nice, healthy progression, NMS has the worst pace. It just opens up hundreds of options and no context for what you should/shouldn\\'t do.\\n\\nThere\\'s a visor you use to scan/scout things. You hold F to use it. Is there an option to make F toggle? No, because fuck you. Such a simple game design that they miss. And so using the scan for longer than 10 seconds (which you will do frequently) is annoying as hell.\\n\\nHow does a normal flightsim work? W&S are pitch (up/down), A&D are roll (think barrel roll), and Q&E are Yaw (think left/right in a tank). How does NMS work? You use your mouse to point where you want the plane to turn. It\\'s asinine. And it\\'d be one thing if that was the default and you could change to the normal pitch/roll/yaw. But you can\\'t, because fuck you.\\n\\nDo you like characters or plot? Think Destiny was bad? Well this makes Destiny feel like Firewatch or OG KOTOR. There\\'s this annoying \"learning alien words\" grind mechanic that just makes every NPC almost the exact same. Every space port: exact same with different name. And once you go to 5 or 10 planets, they\\'re all the same too. Do they have different names? Sure. But are they essentially the same? Yes. The procedural generation is this game is jut bad. And it FEELs worse.\\n\\nIf you want a good crafting/exploration game, go for Subnautica. Stay as far as you can away from NMS.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Hello Games really wasted their time and money taking No Man\\'s Game to VR when so much else needs to be fixed in this experience.  Base building is superficially interesting, until you actually dig into it.  Then you discover pieces simply do not snap together.  We\\'re just supposed to throw random artifacts onto the screen in a vile attempt at inflicting self-torture when it becomes painfully obvious that these two pieces that ought to connect to one another, simply do not.\\n\\nThis is supposed to be a simulation game.  So where are the waterfalls? Where are the ruins of past civilizations?  Where are the present civilizations?  Why does every planet have spacecraft flying across the skies in an obscene effort to make it seem as thought there is other life when really there\\'s just you? Why is our entire existence in this game just 2-3 bars that go up and down based on fundamentally simple mechanics with no substance or even effort at a facade of life to them?  \\n\\nIt\\'s as though the development team was tasked with making a grand painting, and then turned off all the lights and gave you a flashlight to ride around in that could only see 3 inches in front of you for half the day.  \\n\\nThen there is the language mini-game where you seek out lost words for three different races only to discover they really had nothing interesting to say to begin with.  \\n\\nThe game makes you walk at a snails pace in an incomprehensibly vast universe, only to slow you down from getting to where you want to go so that it takes you longer to realize there\\'s no real point of going anywhere at all.  \\n\\nYou have a gun, but the only thing you need to shoot at are the annoying wildlife that run up to you and schizophrenic drones that let you tear apart the landscape, but go ape-shit crazy the moment you blow up a rock. \\n\\nNo Man\\'s Game could have been great, if the developers were given the task of building substance over fluff.  Fluff being VR(As though shoving a visor on my head is going to improve my experience somehow).  \\n\\nI think the developers did an amazing job.  And like all projects, the fault lies with the project managers who steered this piece of wonder into an iceberg just to watch it sink.\\n\\nBuy this game at $60 if you hate the world and yourself, because there\\'s clearly better things you could do with $60 than throw it at Hello Games for making an application that only the Terrible Trivum could love.\\n\\n\"If you only do the easy and useless jobs, you’ll never have to worry about the important ones which are so difficult. You just won’t have the time. For there’s always something to do to keep you from what you really should be doing.. . .\"',\n",

       "  'review': \"I gave this game a decent run through I believe. In the end my interest waned dramatically when I guess I realized there would be no narrative pay off ever, or if there is one, whatever was being setup didn't seem worth it.\\nIn terms of the selling points of an endless universe, it's there, but is thoroughly uninspiring. Of the planets I visited I found them to be 98% similar to others of their type. A radioactive planet is a radioactive planet. The plants will shift slightly, the creatures might have an extra wing. The potential wonder of an infinitely procedural universe is there, but in practice it seems dull and largely repetitive.\\nThe NPCs you encounter on any base seem like a software test from the early 90s. There's little to no reason to interact with them. There's a formulaic run through to learn a word, a tedious and unrewarding mechanic again.\\nSpace fights are dull beyond compare. I remember playing the original Wing Commander on PC with profound excitement. These feel like tech demos bolted onto the side. The enemy ships spin, fire, fly past. Your controls are designed for interplanetary navigation at a large scale. (Point, zip to location) so dog fights quickly become wrote and repetitive as well.\\n\\nBase building mechanic is interesting, but doesn't seemingly pay off in any interesting way other than to show others your base building prowess, which can be fun.\\n\\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game is obviously an afterthought. I tried it several times, only paired with another player once for a brief quest to throw treats at a heard of animals. \\nThe nexus, which was designed to bring players together doesn't feel like a social space at all. The instanced multiplayer that is available doesn't seem to add anything of note from my experience.\\n\\nI enthusiastically explored it for the first 40 hours of gameplay, my interest and curiosity in the environment maintained its momentum for the most part. There were a handful of moments where I just hit huge walls wondering where and what to do next.\\nAt the end, realizing that without any earnest narrative aspect in a game like this, all the missions you can get are go-for missions. Bring me thing. Goto building, it's a procedural universe, but every supply depot across 5-quintillion stars all look exactly the same.\\nGood for a lark, but I experienced a steep drop off in interest.\",\n",

Being able to fly from the surface of a planet and rocket across the solar ship and touch down on another planet seamlessly feels incredible.  Unfortunately that's about the only good thing about the game.\\n\\nNMS is set up to reward exploration, except it doesn't ever fell like there's anything to explore.  If you touch down on a planet and look at everything you can immediately see then you've seen everything that planet has to offer.  There is some mild differences in it being a hot or cold planet, toxic or radiated.  But the only difference that has on gameplay is the color tint on the landscape.\\n  \\nThis is a minor person irritation, but all the wrong places seem populated. No matter how isolated or barren a planet I could find there were random npc ships flying over my head aimlessly.  The only point of civilization in each solar system is the space station which is a colossal structure which has like six guys on it, but there are hundreds of aliens patrolling directly over my base in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\nI had heard this game was horrifyingly disappoint at launch.  I can't imagine what it was like then because even now on sale I feel like I wasted my money.\",\n",

I\\'m stuck with the retarded VR controllers…\\n\\nI realize not many people care about VR but those who do are looking for \"real games\" and \"No Man\\'s Sky\" is AMAZING in VR - except there’s no way to play it! You got to pick your poison: The retarded VR controller or blind keyboard and mouse - which is of course super annoying. :(\\n\\nI will not refund the game because I picked it up on sale and I kinda want to support those guys. If I had paid full price, I would return it for sure.\\n\\nIn case you are angry at me for the negative review without me getting to know the game itself at all: Well I would love to!

       "  'review': \"I loved this game. Was an enjoyable and relaxing thing to goof with, in my downtime. Sure, it gets to be repetitive after a time. Sure, it's had some rather buggy messes that take awhile to hammer out, before new ones (and often old ones) appear from an update. The game has many flaws, but also many good qualities that made it worth playing, for me.\\n\\nThat came to an end after Beyond launched. Suddenly, a game I could always run nice, smooth and crisp, became the ONLY one in my entire library that BsoD's my computer, repeatedly. Change resolution? Blue Screen. Change any graphical setting? Blue Screen. So much as sniffle the wrong way while praying to whatever PC gods that my hardware wasn't failing? Blue Screen. \\n\\nJust tried the game, after a couple months hiatus and first thing that happens, when I go to change resolution.....effing Blue Screen. Tired of seeing everyone play it off that 'oh, it's on your end, it's your hardware, it's your hardware, it's your fault not the game'. Bullcrap. Seems if you're unlucky enough to have a 1060 6gb GPU (looks like the primary card this game now hates with a passion) you may be screwed. \\n\\nI did all the hardware scans, cleans, upgrades to RAM and checks I needed to do, short of rebuilding the damned computer and everything came back A. Effing. OK. But nope, guess it must be failing hardware, still. I loved this game and still would love to play it, but for the foreseeable future, it'll collect virtual dust in my library, because I'm sure as hell not going to dish out hundreds solely to rebuild, just for this game. That money will be put to better use for my kids, I love them more than this mess.\\n\\nOh and if I wanted to see a ton of blue on my screen, I'd make a freaking smurf simulator. Can't recommend this, as much as I hate to give it a thumbs down, I truly do, but I've been burned one too many times by this.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"No Man's Sky...does it really make a comeback after all this year from the horrendous broken promises of a game Dev? Good news is the Dev did not abandoned the game and still slowly pushing update. NMS really improve,a little....from their disappointing launch that shook the core of the gaming community galaxywide once. In 2019 No Man's Sky does improve from the heyday but still has many flaw within that really be a major drawback for many player. Long story short the current trailer and screenshot look fabulously immersive gorgeous but the game will never run that optimize unless you had one powerful gaming PC nor the content could offer immersive yet adventurous world to dwell in and explore, like the trailer.\\n\\n The NMS-Optimize rOooOOller-cOOooOOOoasteR ride is real, the FPS is climbing and dropping here,there,left,right and everywhere. The content is  literally GALAXY large but feel so empty at the same time. No Man's Sky feel like cardboard background world, All the exploration,planet and biomes feel like same sh!t different toilet, different toilet same sh!t, the worst it still cost premium entry charge.\\n \\n No Man Sky doesn't have the simple and yet in-depth immersive feeling like other survival+exploration games such as Subnautica,Astroneer or The Forest. In those mention title,their game is very simple yet fill with diversive details and the exploration will always take away another 5 minutes of your life. Those title made us feel so adventurous and immersive with every little things, that made us want to explore for more and more! That...No Man's Sky couldn't offer.\\n\\n Soundtrack does really blend impressive well with the game, credit had to be gaven for such a good immersion OST but wasted on bland empty LARGE galaxy with nothing to offer B.E.Y.O.N.D™. I sincerely love the game and hope to see No Man's Sky could offer more sustainable content, more attention on little details biomes and good optimization in the future but in the current state No Man's Sky doesn't worth the full price nor at 50% discounted sales, best at 65% discount and value at 70% discount currently.\\n\\n No Man's Sky is still a lovely game but with bad optimization,gamebreaking bugs and many missing details to make the world immersive enough. If you had a friend that wanna play together then it might worth the 50% discount due to companionship and together time. Else I strongly recommended just to check out Subnautica and others title of survival-explorer instead. \\n\\n To infinity and B.E.Y.O.N.D™ ! Your fighter jet somehow misflight and glitch stuck to the roof...Your last save 60 mins ago.....GAH!!! @#$#%^$&^%*(*^FUKK!!!\",\n",

Building, shooting, crafting, space combat, exploration etc.. unfortunatelly its just not enough of any of those and becomes repeatative fast. The world is indeed innormouse every planet is huge every system has 1-8 planets and there's pretty much an uncountable amount of systems.. however there's a couple of serious issues with that. first of all there's no biomes or rather very little biomes in the planets if you find a frozen planet its 90% frozen if you find a green one its 90% green. There's only a few types of biomes with very little difference between one lets say fiary planet to another and the generated structures on those planets are limited as well all adding up to exploring one planet is all the exploration your getting You can go and explore a new planet but your just gonna end up on a different shade of the same buildings and sites. The game has a crafting system which is unfortunatelly mostly used for making money and you need to go through an endless building hunt to unlock the recepies for that.. there's missions but they range between 5 different variations and after that its just more of the same. all and all. You can build your base which is really cool but the moment you join somebodies game the issues start... your base only half loads on their end.. they cant interact with most things.. the containers are personalised the terrain your demolished keeps regrowing inside the base (lets say you take down a tree to build a room.. well the tree just pops clipping through your entire struckture). Now all that said the game is still being updated and hopefully in a couple of years we'll get something playable.\",\n",

Base building. I spent half of my day yesterday just building a base just to find out later that it's raining inside the house (bad outside effects works inside the house) spent the other half trying to put on roof at different heights but nothing worked. I don't have any motivation to play more if i can't build a new working base/home.\\n\\n2. I bought this game mainly because of VR, which is unplayable at the moment (for me) as the HUD is stuck in one place. So if the HUD is behind you , you have to literally turn your head/body around to check your health or if you're not dying from lack of oxygen or something.\\n\\nAlmost everything else in VR is made right, it's not just a simple port, you take out your gun by reaching your back, spaceship has amazing controls (you need to control buttons/sticks in the cockpit)\",\n",

Menus, inventory management, and game play all feel very inefficient and tedious and are a serious barrier to enjoying the game. I thought having experience with games like Mine Craft and Creativerse would have made the transition to this game easier but No Man's Sky is a different animal even tho it shares many concepts (crafting, farming, taming animals). Meaningful achievements are too spread out and short lived when you find yourself needing to complete more time consuming tedious tasks to reach your next goal. It is an overwhelmingly large gaming experience which would be exciting until your brain does the math and realizes how much time it would take to accomplish what you want in the game.\\n\\nIn short it's a game that could be amazing but shoots itself in the foot by asking too much micromanagement of the gamer. (Just auto-refill all my technology if i have the resources, geez!)\\n\\nNot worth the $60 or even the $30 sale price I paid for it. $10, maybe... until they balance out the game play.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I originally preordered this game when it originally came out and wasnt one of the people who hated the game.  I played for about 65 hours total back then but ended up getting bored and moving on.\\n\\nRecently, I came back to check out all the updates Ive heard about since then.  It really is impressive the amount of content that has been added, completely changing the experience of the game.  Theres a lot to do and check out.  The few issues I had thought were enough to not recommend though.\\n\\nMy computer isnt amazing, but I am able to play games like destiny 2 on max graphics or Ark on high with no issues.  This game, no matter how much I messed with settings, has massive FPS issues when entering buildings, getting in any exocraft, or entering a new chunk of land.  Exocrafts randomly decide to become invisible temporarily when exiting sometimes, normally fixed when reloading.  Also random machines inside my base temporarily disappear, fixed the same way but all items inside the machines dont come back.  \\n\\nWhile trying to explore i had issues with fauna disappearing and spawning right in from of me.  Also any aquatic animals do not exist until being underwater for about 5 seconds and disappear again when you surface.\\n\\nOverall I found all the new stuff very impressive, but all my issues were with things that have been in the game for a while now and were game disrupting enough for me to not recommend this, even with all the free updates.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So I actually like the game and will play it more. Despite all bugs and unfinished systems. But I will probably never give this game a positive raiting because of two things.\\n1. Sentinels. Too many planets have them. On survival every planet is full of them. Every 10 seconds or so you have to dodge this stupid flying vermin. If you kill one even more will spawn at exactly your location. Yes survival should be harder, but not like this. Sentinels are dumb and not interesting. They just annoy you in every step of the way. Sentinel spawn rates, AI and how sentinels work should be completely reworked or even removed.\\n2. Space pirates. Same as with sentinels. Encounters are too frequent and uninteresting. Always the same. They are easy to run away from, easy to kill. 0 fun and gain in actually fighting them. Same as with sentinels the spawn rate and whole system maybe even space combat should be redone. So if space pirates attack you it would actually mean something, be different and fun to fight with them.\\n\\nRight now sentinels and pirates are just annoying vermins. Despite all bugs these two things are the actual fun killers of normal and especially survival game modes. I like survival mode and I do not mind a little more grinding to get things I want, but these two things are not the way survival should feel like. Sentinels and pirates are ruining a possibility to enjoy this amazing, beautiful and enormous universe. I cannot stress enough how much I hate sentinels and pirates in this game and how much they are ruining the experience.\\n\\nI really hope developers will make things better with pirates and sentinels. Fix more bugs and add more content. If this is the case I personally would not mind paying for DLC if this is something developers need to support this game even longer than they already have.\\n\\nEdit 28.11.2019: Got to give developers credit for synthesis update. Great job and awesome update. But still do not see any changes to sentinels and space pirates!',\n",

       "  'review': 'I have always loved the idea of this game. I always pop into it for a few days after each new update to see what has changed and, more-often-than-not, to rebuild my base as most things get messed up by bugs or wiped after each update.\\nHowever, I will not recommend it or consider it in a positive light until everything that was promised to be in this game, is in this game. I pre-purchased this back when Hello Games were promising it to be everything an open world survival gamer wanted and it was such a disappointment when it was released that I treat everything they say about each successive update or what they are planning to do next with great scepticism.\\nYes, each new update brings the game one step closer to what was promised. But it has been out for YEARS now! It should have been mostly finished on release!\\n\\nAlso, the free ship you got with the pre-purchase as well as the new multiplayer aspects suck big salty balls.',\n",

Not so much.\\n\\n*** Update at 165 hours played as requested by steam... ***\\n\\nJust before returning to this page after having to force-exit the game and lose more progress I ran into, in a few minutes, the following bugs:\\n\\n* Mission Rewards not matching rewards advertised on taking the mission, substituting cheap trash for the very valuable eggs I was after.\\n* Missions vanishing entirely.\\n* Faction icons not matching faction given.\\n* Feedback text overwriting itself too fast to be read.\\n\\nAnd finally:\\n\\n* On exiting from turning in missions my game getting the camera stuck on the turn-in NPC, orbiting it and not allowing me to interact with it or anything else. The only solution I could find was to force the program to exit, and load from the time I entered the station.\\n\\nSo why am I playing? I like exploring, and I like bright vivid colors. :P\\n\\n*** More Update ***\\n\\nThe main quest just vanished out of my quest log. I mean. I literally can not finish the story now short of starting a new playthrough. After 165+ hours or whatever it is now.\\n\\nDespite all the other bugs I could mention, I believe this particular one sums up my No Man's Sky experience.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b]The positives:[/b]\\n\\n-Loading times are nonexistent after booting up into the game. You can freely fly in space and enter planets without a single load time. Only exist when you use the warp feature to visit nearby systems. Very impressed by that. \\n\\n-You do feel a sense of exploration when playing this game. You can discover planets and rename each organism, mineral and plant to your own accord.\\n\\n-Has interesting mechanics like the language learning of different alien species. You can´t understand them at the beginning and have to learn their words to properly make out their speech. \\n\\n-Improved multiplayer capabilities. Now you can undergo missions with other players and take on tasks together. Very nice recent addition to the game. \\n\\n-Game offers different play style options for people. Some might play the game as a pure exploration game, some might have fun making money and crashing the economy of some systems and there is also base building for those who have fun creating structures on their own. \\n\\n\\n[b]The Negatives:[/b]\\n\\n-Terrain loading is horrible. Constant pop ins of animals or trees, Makes it hard to fly low on a planet when there is the danger of flying against a tree that suddenly appears in front of you. \\n\\n-Textures randomly don´t load correctly, causing npc´s and environments to use the low poly version, intended for far away objects to save on hardware resources. \\n\\n-Placement problems with buildings, regarding the freighter. Some rooms like the command room glitch out when trying to place, makes it nearly impossible to set it up without very precise placement on a specific spot. \\n\\n-Planets feel very similar to each other. Once you visited a handful of them, you know what to expect from the terrain generation. Looking at the 1.0 footage of the game shows more variety in planet generation, with more interesting structures than we currently have. I Propose an overwork of this feature, give the system more freedom and choices when generating a planet. \\n\\n\\n[b]Tldr:[/b] Nice and fun game about space with lots of various things to offer for the player, but it´s held back by the countless technical issues and bugs. If they ever get fixed, especially the terrain loading bug, I would recommend this game. As of now, only on a sale. Full price is currently not justified.',\n",

       "  'review': \"TL;DR Summary: An overly ambitious concept game from a team who clearly know how to dream, but not how to execute. As a result, the game remains in a permanent beta state that, as of now, just barely fulfills the promises made five years ago - once you get past all the bugs and quirks.\\n\\nDon’t let my play time fool you, those 294 hours are not an endorsement to the quality of the game, rather, they are a sad testament to my personal flavour of obsessive crazy, and the combined result of three separate instances of trying out this game. The first was launch day, where I had pre-ordered the game only to find it wouldn’t even run on my rig, despite my specs grossly exceeding the minimums – though that actually made me lucky, since it let me refund the launch price and then watch the overwhelmingly negative reviews roll in. The second was about 18 months ago, after one of the major updates, where I repurchased at a much lower price, messed around for a few hours, and quit out of boredom. It was only on the third try, after the BEYOND update and watching a friend stream some gameplay, that No Man’s Sky finally hooked me.\\n\\nLooking at this game’s spotty history it’s clear that Hello Games are a passionate group of artists who genuinely want to produce their vision, but I cannot help but imagine their development meetings being similar to two first-year college students, one a first year physics major and the other first year philosophy, both stoned out of their gourds with quality weed, discussing the universe and its purpose. A lot of crazy ideas, most of which only sound brilliant to them, and the few potential diamonds that come from their ramblings barely understood in the garbled memories and shorthand notes found the next day. They came up with an awesome idea, and presented it in a surprisingly dark and ominous setting. But the development is clearly scattered and on “valve time”, with priorities shifting from update to update and questionable focus (such as three times as many different types of craftable food than types of planets. I wish that was a joke). More than three years later, it’s still in an unpolished beta state, riddled with bugs and severely lacking in quality of life features, and with the clear understanding anything can be changed and corrupted with each update, even the core procedural generation that might just rewrite the entire universe. \\n\\nSo how did this mess hook me? The aforementioned setting. It’s not apparent right away, which is why I missed it on my second try, but as you progress past the initial survival scramble and start dipping your toe into the vast stellar ocean, a bunch of small things you notice soon snowball into a simple realization.\\n\\n[b]The universe is rotting.[/b]\\n\\nThere’s something fundamentally wrong about the state of the galaxy, and rotting is the best word I can think of to explain the feeling. This is not a (cosmic scale) young and growing universe like our own; the universe of No Man’s Sky is old, and under its sheen of being fully settled and populated, it is decaying, like some infection is slowly and irreversibly destroying it. And given how much of that decay is tied to logs and notes that are the only communication in a language you understand...[b]you might just be the one of the viruses[/b]. \\n\\nBecause you are alone. There’s three races that cohabitate all known areas of the galaxy – the [strike]Vulcans[/strike] Korvax, the [strike]Klingons[/strike] Vy’keen, and the [strike]Ferengi[/strike] Gek – but it seems not so much as that they have conquered the galaxy, as that they merely inhabit it, inheriting a network and technology and entire civilization that came before, and that for some reason has disappeared, leaving only artifacts and the omnipresent Sentinels to police the universe to their unwavering lawful neutral agenda. And in meeting those races, it is clear that you’re not one of them. Their languages are garbled to you, but they seem to treat you with respect that borders on fear. Only when you explore, wandering across planetary landscapes littered with discarded trash, broken machinery, and abandoned crash sites, will you eventually come across a language you understand. But that will bring you no comfort, for these words either come as creepypasta extracted from the slime covered computer of an infested and abandoned building, or from some ancient relic that predates the three races above, or from some freakish entity, glowing and ephemeral, speaking either of nonsense or of certain doom. Like them, you are an anomaly. \\n\\n[b]You are a Traveller.[/b]\\n\\nSo yeah, it hooked me.  But as said before, the actual mechanics of how this all works, of the gameplay that you go through to make the story progress from there, and that fulfils the original promise of “endless exploration in an infinite but shared universe” falls flat. It is incredibly grindy, repetitive, poorly optimised, and full of stupid bugs that even the most basic quality assurance procedures should catch. All the reviews seem to quote “wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle”, and I’ll repeat it since it’s 100% correct. There are only 9 planet templates – which, if you’re generous grows to 15 if you count “with oceans” and “without oceans” as different, but I don’t – and only the rarest two of those templates have any meaningful subtypes. The challenge curve is negative, because the universe is so generic that nothing changes with your travels aside from you personally growing stronger with upgrades to your suit, weapon, and ship. And those upgrades take forever, as the increments of improvement are often so minor, or only available at the whim of RNGeezus. So you just keep going to the same places, and doing the same things, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and it gets mindlessly easier every time. By the time I reached the centre, I had to travel through 297 systems, and since I [strike]wanted[/strike] obsessively felt I had to “tag” every planet, that meant I landed on and at least nominally explored (as in, stood in one place and scanned everything I could see) 588 planets – so yes, I cherry-picked systems that only had one or two planets whenever I could.\\n\\nAnd then, after 294 hours of that and finally reaching the centre, you apparently stop and write a negative review. Because, like I said, personal flavour of obsessive crazy. To hammer home the point, I was going to end with just a laundry list of stuff that annoyed me, and kept the game from ever being fun, rather than something I just felt I had to finish.  Which would have been fitting, because just like this review wouldn't have had a proper end, neither does the game. This list was as of the BEYOND update, and is scattered, incomplete, and only loosely organized. Again, like the game itself. \\n\\nBut it's so long, it would make the review exceed the word count. Too much ambition, not enough execution. So it is fitting, after all.\\n\\nIt's in the comments below.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"TL:DR - the game doesn't support a traditional 'joystick,' and certainly not a HOTAS.\\n\\nWhen No Many's Sky was released, it fell short of the hype.  That has certainly dramatically improved.  But even though it fell short, I enjoyed the game.  It did not advertise nor support using a traditional Joystick.  It worked with the Xbox 360 controller only.  Personally, I do not enjoy using a gamepad or mouse to 'fly' a space ship.  So I used x360ce to emulate the Xbox360 controller.  And then I used my Logitech or Thrustmaster to control the ship.\\n\\nBut then along came the BEYOND update.  And Hello Games made the decision to integrate with Steam BIg Picture.  That bricked x360ce, and so the game is back to just supporting a mouse or a gamepad.  Oh, sure, you can map a generic controller in Steam Big Picture.  But the problem is, to map a generic controller as a 360 or steam controller, it has to have at least as many buttons as the one you're emulating.  Therefore, neither my joystick nor HOTAS will work anymore.\\n\\nFor this reason I can't recommend this game.\\n\\nIf you find a workaround, then great!  The core game is fun.  There is plenty to do (despite some reviews.)\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dont believe what you've heard, this game is still a terrible broken mess, and what isn't broken is intentionally tedious. If I were going to design a game intended to frustrate people while taking as much of their time as possible, it would probably look a lot like this game.\\n\\nYou cant just select anything, any selection requires you to hold a button for about 2 seconds. In game, in inventory, in settings menu, even in the freaking title screen, you need to hold a button for a second or to to do ANYTHING.\\n\\nThere are some items you need to break open in your inventory to get goodies inside. Fine. But you can only break one at a time, so you need to press the button for each individual one. Only you cant just press the button, of course, you need to hold it for 2 seconds. It takes forever, not sure where the fun is in this particular mechanic.\\n\\nThe game content is spread as thin as possible. The gameplay is pretty boring and tedious as I said, but just before you give up on the game, you'll find something that makes you think the game is going to open up or start something more fun. But an hour or so later, you'll realize anything new is just as tedious and boring as what you were doing before.\\n\\nAnd all that is assuming the game functions as intended, which it often doesn't.\\n\\nBeside frequent crashes, there are graphical issues, and even parts where you can get flung through your hull and out into space. All over the frieghter base, you can go through walls and get stuck and die, losing hours of tedious progress.\\n\\nIf you enjoy the experience of bashing your head into a wall over and over, this game is for you!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is one of the best/worst games out there. I hate needing to rate this as either Recommended or not Recommended. This would be very neutral for me. However, since those are the options, I need to lean on the not recommended side. Don’t let that sway you from picking the game up on a sale. It’s an interesting game. \\n\\nTLDR: Awesome exploration game. Riddled with game breaking bugs that have been around for years. HG still hasn’t taken necessary steps to fix them, rather they’re worried about providing VR to 1% of the players.\\n\\n [h1] Pros  [/h1]\\n1. Great looking game.\\n \\n2. Awesome exploration concept. Who doesn’t like being able to travel from solar system to solar system exploring multiple galaxies?\\n\\n3. I love the building/crafting in this game. I love grindy games. Don’t get it wrong either. This is about as grindy as you can get. \\n\\n [h1] Cons  [/h1]\\n1. Bugs galore. Hello Games is TERRIBLE at correcting bugs. There’re bugs that’ve been around since the inception. Some are quite game braking. Countless times I’ll be doing a main story quest, just to have it stop working. When that happens, there are only two things you can do. Keep grinding out mats, and pray to Jesus that it un-f*cks itself and starts working. Or kiss your 90 hour save goodbye, and start all over. No idea why this isn’t a to priority for HG. \\n\\n2. Materials are still disappearing from harvesters, refiners, mining units etc. nobody likes wasting time.\\n\\n3. The terrain still “grows” back. Meaning that after you level off a nice area and build your base. The next time you log in, prepare to have your base filled in with sediment. What makes it even better is, you can’t use your terrain tool to clear it out most of the time. Because you can’t use the terrain gun while in a habitat. So, you must destroy your base, and rebuild. \\n\\n [h1] Conclusion  [/h1] \\nI’ve spent more time trying to work around game bugs than playing the game. Either by going back and forth a hundred times trying to get a mission to properly start, or constantly saving the game, shutting it down and trying to edit the save files so that I can get some sort of progression. I’ve finally realized that enough is enough. There are plenty of other games out there that’re more deserving of your time than this one.\\nThis game is not worth $60 USD. Pick it up on a sale sometime. Definitely don’t pay $60 for an unfinished game. \\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'First, after close to 300h in I surely think the game\\'s concept is pretty awesome and worthwile. IF only the most severe bugs were tracked down.\\n\\nEspecially resets and not saving progress can make the game overly frustrating. I write this as a warning, in my first like 50 hours none of it was a big issue, but it became a growing pain.\\n\\n- Base building: If you build a base, don\\'t even bother removing or editing terrain and beware building it inside a mountain. All terrain will grow back and overgrow your base, including facilities, landing platforms, doors etc. Plants and rocks will regrow through the floors even.\\n\\n- Bases on Freighters: A mobile base, how cool is that. However, only if you NEVER move your freighter you should try this. I built couple hours on the interior, storages, plants, rooms, neat decorations, even a manual saving point because, ya know, saving is everything after all this work. Few hours later I warped my freighter to my home base, thinking about nothing bad and *poof* each and every single customization was gone. Completely. Reset to zero and of course not even giving me back materials. I mean, really???\\n\\n- Explorations: The game is all about exploring randomly generated star systems. You can literally name everything, every planet, every plant, every animal, make it yours. Sounds great, huh? Only that after a couple planets it all gets - likely - overwritten by your newer discoveries. How hard it is to SAVE customizations and explorations in the cloud and provide them when I revisit a planet? Yes, you can re-explore and re-scan everything on the older planets you discovered and eventually the old names (if they were uploaded to the server before) show again.\\nBut this is not what makes you feel like progressing. Even space stations you visit reset completely after a while, as if you never talked to anyone there. What are bazillion planets for if you don\\'t really need to move; you can stay where you are and rediscover old stuff over and over again since the game forgets you were there, all the time. Hardly anything gets saved.\\n\\nThere\\'s a hell lot of other bugs like facilities not working, false info, storages not accessible at times, modules not building, multiplayer issues (the game is single player, originally, and it shows everywhere) etc. However, I don\\'t mind all these. Save my customizations, buildings and explorations already and I\\'d be happily recommending the game, wholeheartedly.\\n\\nAlso despite infinite planets the game got a definite ending point where you got the feeling to have it played \"through\". After doing all quests you only can do the ever-same 3 dailies, one more daily task for Quicksilver or randomly explore planets which are no longer really surprising, though. Once you know the main \"types\" this is all pretty repetitive.\\nIt\\'s nice to come back now and then, also I stayed much longer than friends, but it simply won\\'t tie you up as much (or at all) anymore, once there\\'s no longer real goals to pursue.\\n',\n",

However, the reason for this negative review is simply that playing cooperative is nearly impossible due to constant and extremely gamebreaking bugs. It is nearly impossible to last more than 10 minutes (and even that is being generous) in a coop game without having your friends disappear completely, having your base implode into a black hole and disappear forever, or even having all of your AI companions delete themselves from existence.\\n\\nI don't usually write reviews but I had noticed a significant lack of other reviews mentioning these annoying and experience-ruining bugs that plague every playthrough I've had with my friends, and I simply cannot recommend that anyone purchases this game if they're looking for a smooth coop experience because you won't find it.\",\n",

The process to get your ship repaired and flying is an incredibly tedious series of grinds. Everything in this game felt like a chore. The tutorial isn\\'t very helpful and really might as well not be there other than to guide you through the \"story\". The game at times can be frustrating. However, with all that being said..... the game is fun. The feeling of warping into a new unexplored solar system is incredible. This game is not for everyone. It feels like a cross between Elite Dangerous and Minecraft. Not worth the full asking price but perfect for $25 or less.',\n",

Otherwise the glitch filled void that is No Man's Sky gets super repetitive with no real payoff. There still isn't any 'end game' content, which would be fine if the sandbox elements had some tangible value, and worked. For example, base building, it is feature lacking, buggy, and objectively pointless, due to freighters and how every space station has a teleporter.  Not to mention the many bugs that plague basic gameplay like; dialogue, object collision, enemy A.I, player physics, and even opening containers. Like I said, I really want to recommend this game, it is a really cool concept and I think that hello games should be praised for sticking with a game that had such a rough launch, but until the game has any gameplay or sandbox features that give you something to do other than scanning and grinding for ships, I cannot in good conscience recommend it.\",\n",

First, the annoying robot voice that won't stop telling you that your systems are failing. Every time you go out in the open it has to announce it. Also, it would be nice if it gave you invincibility for your first time playing. For the tutorial. I died 4-5 times during the part where I was supposed to be learning how to play. Or maybe the scanner shouldn't have a cool down during the tutorial since it kept telling me to use the scanner to find something, but I used it inside so it didn't find anything. And it kept bothering me to use the scanner when I was in cool down. Overall, if you like dying a lot, go ahead and buy the game. If not, well don't. It kind of pains me to write a bad review for a game as I haven't ever before.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve heard so many mixed reviews about NO MAN\\'S SKY that made me wonder what all the fuzz was about. On the surface the game seems to be something I might enjoy, combining exploration on a vast scale, building, crafting and handsome looking graphics. The asking price of $60 promises a AAA title, so when it was on sale the other day, both on Steam and on GOG, I picked it up and had a look at it.\\n\\nI\\'m coming into this game cold, not knowing what to expect. I literally had no expectations, other than the hope of having a good time. Sadly that didn\\'t happen. It can be like that with complex games though, you have to give it an hour or two to get into them, learn the interface, understand what you\\'re supposed to do. Good games (like any good software) will help you make this a welcoming experience. \\n\\nNO MAN\\'S SKY doesn\\'t do that. It\\'s not even trying. \\n\\nThe premise of the game is that we\\'ve lost our memory, crash landed on a planet, our space ship is broken, life support in our suit is failing, and we have to find  way to survive (not necessarily in that order). We need to fix that multi tool, hunt for resources, build some spare parts and get off this rock. Where have I heard that story before?\\n\\nWhat usually happens is that you\\'re given a quick tutorial as to what buttons to press and how to do things. Like a brief tutorial, even if it\\'s disguised as a mission of sorts. NO MAN\\'S SKY doesn\\'t do that. Instead you\\'re left to figure out an overly complex, unintuitive, badly designed interface all by yourself. No matter what buttons I pressed, it was not obvious to me how to navigate around. I was playing with a game controller, and while it is fully supported and recognised, the mapping and navigation wasn\\'t really made for it - nor did they try very hard getting to get it right. Bizarre concept for a console release.\\n\\nEventually I figured out the basics, after what feels like half an hour, and it certainly wasn\\'t fun getting to that point. The next thing the game does is send you far away to a distant point in the desolate landscape, to retrieve some vital part necessary for fixing my ship. To get there we have to walk 20 minutes through a wasteland that is the procedurally generated planet. We meet some procedural animals, plants, marvel at the day/night cycle and the ever changing light effects, all the while making sure we don\\'t die of heat exposure. Nothing else happens. For 20 minutes of my life. \\n\\nWhen we finally retrieve that \"thing\" we need, we walk back to our ship, through the same landscape we\\'ve already seen, for yet another 20 minutes. We may encounter a structure to explore on the way, but it becomes painfully obvious that perhaps a car or some other form of transportation would come in handy. Maybe at some point we\\'ll find out how to build one, but it doesn\\'t help us right now - having just wasted 40 minutes of our lives doing nothing other than push that left thumb stick forward, or hold down the W key. We finally get back to the ship, put that part in, only to find out that we now have to find some resources to progress. We walk around, we scan things, we use that laster thing to harvest things, and that about wraps it up for my two hour test of the game.\\n\\nSo what just happened? Am I hooked on NO MAN\\'S SKY? Am I eager to see where this is going? What other worlds and wonders lie ahead? How am I feeling? Is this the beginning of an exciting journey, an intriguing story that I can\\'t wait to see unfold?\\n\\nActually no. I\\'m frustrated, disappointed, bored to death with this game. The feeling of having been ripped off seeps in, so much so that I take a look at Steam\\'s refund policy. It\\'s that bad!\\nI truly appreciate what Hello Games have tried to implement here: a fully procedural universe with (probably) tons of features, lush underwater worlds, vehicles and buildings I could build, uncover intriguing mysteries - but it seems that I\\'m destined never to see any of that. Had it not been for the various launch and update trailers, I would have no idea those things even exist in the game.\\n\\nSo I give NO MAN\\'S SKY the benefit of the doubt and start a new game, this time in creative mode. That\\'s the one where we don\\'t have to worry about survival or resource hunting. We can just start building things and see if that\\'s more welcoming. I know it greatly helped me get the hang of Subnautica. But that logic doesn\\'t hold true here: the interface is so unintuitive that it\\'s impossible for me to work out how to build anything.\\n\\nThe final  thing I\\'ve tried was to leave the planet, and see what another procedurally generated world might look like. Be dazzled by that no-loading-screen take-off and landing sequence I\\'ve heard so much about. So I jump into my (magically no longer damaged) space ship, exploring the cockpit, and... nothing. All I can do is get in and out. There are no controls, no buttons, no explanations, no nothing. Are they serious? Nobody noticed these fatal design flaws during play testing?\\nPuzzled and confused, I go back into my previous game. There has to be more to NO MAN\\'S SKY than this. I spend another hour walking around, trying really hard to like this game. Knowing full well that \"this\" can\\'t be everything. There has to be something here that hooks the player\\'s attention before they hit \"uninstall\". But no matter what I do, all I feel at this point is that this game isn\\'t for me. Perhaps it\\'s totally obvious what players have to do, and maybe I\\'m just too stupid or too old - or maybe I\\'m just painfully aware that our time on THIS planet (Earth) is way too short to waste it on badly designed prototypes like NO MAN\\'S SKY. \\n\\nI really appreciate that the team have been sticking this one out. I love that three years after it\\'s original (flawed) release in 2016, they\\'re bringing out major upgrades in this game for free. They\\'re tirelessly working on their original vision, they\\'ve been under huge scrutiny for years, and they\\'re still in business. They haven\\'t given up, and I give them 10 out of 10 stars for hanging in there. \\n\\nI feel reminded of Mass Effect Andromeda, whose team knew early on that they\\'ve built a lemon, and very quickly abandoned the project after release. Fix what you can, then cut your losses and move on. That\\'s what most humans would do, especially if there\\'s finance people involved. But Hello Games didn\\'t do that. They believed in NO MAN\\'S SKY, and they continue to believe in it. Besides, the graphics are beautiful. Photo Mode is extremely well implemented and a lot of fun to play with. We can take beautiful shots with this game in real time. The character animations are nice, the sound design is great, and I really get a feeling of abandoned loneliness on that one planet I was able to explore. I can imagine that had I gotten into it, this could have been a great long journey and an enjoyable experience for me, and my viewers alike.\\n\\nWhich is why is pains me to say that, without any discernible story, a terribly designed interface, and the complete non-starter experience I\\'ve made, I\\'m now so bored with the game that I can only abandon it and move on. Sorry team, it\\'s not for me. How many hours do you expect me to give you? Five? Ten? Twenty? Imagine investing that much time into a game and not getting anything in return? \\n\\nIf a game has \"mixed\" reviews, it means there aren\\'t just a couple of nut jobs out there who dislike it. It means you\\'ve not got the basics right. You\\'ve been focussing on things players are likely never to experience, and you\\'ve missed out on showing players what awaits them, or how to get there.\\n\\nRest in peace, NO MAN\\'S SKY.',\n",

If you already own it, and don't seem to have all those bugs or you don't care about the multiplayer aspect, then sure go ahead and buy it in sale. Made the big mistake in 2016 to pre-purchase the game before its release, spent 80$, and 4 years after, those 80$ are still totaly not worth it.\",\n",

And the Nexus mission at anomali station got tons of glitches too. Regret buying it.\\nEdit: Well, it shows that electricity from electromagnetic gen can never give power to a device outside it's original base power grid. Nice to know this before using so much time to figure it out, since it's a lot more to figure out at the same time.\\nI do not recommend this game because of the lack of information and how bad the building system is; making a base is tiresome and difficult, more than it needs to be, and with future tech; why the heck does it need to be so hard to store items in storages.. it's buggy and limited. \\nThis is an exploration game, it's not minecraft, shooter game, multiplayer, strategy, not even close to it. Even though it might seem like that they tried to make an alternative to something similiar here and there. It's an exploration game, and if you mainly don't like to take pictures of random generated stuff that makes no sense then don't buy it. I'm not recommending this game mainly because of all the bugs, I'm glad I was prepared for it searching forums in advance so when the bugs happened(because they will happen), I wasn't that let down.\",\n",

Buy oxygen at the stations, (really load up), and convert it to ionized cobalt.  If you sell it on a station that sells ionized cobalt, you can buy it back for 1/4 of the price and sell it at another station. I made enough this way to buy a ship with 39 cargo holds and make  7-8 million / sale. with 30 stations that sell ionized cobalt I can make a huge amount of money in an hour. BUT it takes a long time  for the economy to recover so I left the game open overnight and while I was at work and sure enough  prices recovered substantially. Once you get rolling with this there is no need to grind for anything except plant parts, just buy it.\",\n",

The shooting, mining, and other things looked boring too. \\n\\nThe random generation thing doesn't do much for wonders. Sure you will get one or two cool looking planet, out of 10 you visited. Most of the planet you visited are just dessert and swamp that doesn't even look good. Colors feel muted, it's really, really rare to see that planet you see in screenshot or promotional material. \\n\\nNavigation in this game is a nightmare, things like car are unlocked later so you must use your plane to move a few meters away since running still felt pretty slow. Also, your plane needed propulsion fuel to take off, so after 4-5 take off you need to refuel it. Which mean more mining for things that you don't really want.\\n\\nTo entertain myself, I usually need to play a podcast and listen to music because it's just so boring. There not slight fun that you find in games like harvest moon, because there isn't really any goal to begin with. \\n\\nThreat? It's just some robot, scorpion, and that's it. Planet with lots of hazard usually have good material, but again, they are not good to look at.\\n\\nConclusion: They should fix the planet generation for this game, put a lot more sights, wonder, or anything to one planet is more appreciated than having bland 1000 planets.\",\n",

Multiple times I was losing hours of progress cause of BUG-s like crashing/being stuck in landing sequence and similar. Mind you game lets you save only in specific momments so any crash/issue when you need to reset your game is costing you progress. Tottal gamebreaker for me completly overshadowing how much they added to the game (Which doesn\\'t look that good anyway).\\n\\nMaybe some people got it to work after searching solutions throgh the forums for specific PC specs but even after doing that I coudn\\'t make it stable. It\\'s not like it should be my job to make game I paid money for work. I know I\\'m not the only player with that experience as forums are full of people describing multiple crash/stuck cases.\\n\\nIf you\\'re like me thinking you can give this game a try - be aware it\\'s a gamble at best in terms of sability and gameplay content was made \"ok-ish\" (if you\\'ll manage to avoid crashes). If I\\'d ignore crash problem I guess I could describe general content as \"mildly interesting\" but the price of this game has been too high for way too long. \\n\\nMaybe grab it when they\\'ll make some propper discount available like other game companies do with product that was out (in this case out and being \"fixed/made into something worth it\") since so long.',\n",

The same problems it has had since launch with its moment to moment gameplay still exist, and the efforts to improve the game have not been targeted enough at the actual fun factor of the game. Its too easy to feel like what your doing is completely pointless and a waste of time, because there aren't enough goals that a player can set for themselves to achieve that are actually fun. \\n\\nI think more work needs to be done on the multiplayer experience, as well as having interesting unlockable items, maybe boss battles or sentinel bases or compounds. That would be nice.\",\n",

I play it casually for a few hours every update and never find the fun.\\n\\nAs a casual player, the only active changes I have seen are to offer food (pellets) to animals and the performance is fantastic (I don't do VR)!\\n\\nHere are some annoyances:\\nLiterally every single time you find anything interesting that joy is immediately killed by needing something else.  (I found a crashed freighter with 3 cargo pods! I couldn't open any of them because I don't have and haven't found any colbalt). \\nYou have a ship, but it costs special fuel to launch. I am constantly launching and landing just to reach one thing I saw on the visor.\\nWhile in low orbit, none of the visor icons appear so I just spent two hours looking for buried tech and trying to get close to it.\\nMoving on foot becomes a pain since my starting planet has high radiation. \\nI already started the base building tutorial so pulling a Patrick and just moving it somewhere else doesn't really work.\\nCannot move things once you build them.  You can only delete and get a portion of mats back so better not fuck it up.\\nYou can only tag one thing at a time despite this being a game about exploration. \\nThird-Person camera is just pointless (more than Bethesda's tpp)\\nThe menus are still just terrible, and the additional building and quick menus just make the problem worse.\\nYou need to be within arms reach of the ship otherwise you cannot transfer inventory. \\nStill never seen another player, but arguably the universe is pretty damn big.  \\n\\nHello Games is still trying, and that is fuckin respectable in 2019! I think my problem is, no matter how many changes they make, the core gameplay is just not fun in my opinion.\",\n",

The worlds are pretty diverse in flora, fauna, and color, though they severely lack in geographical diversity (no mountains, no massive cave systems, no canyons, etc). Building is well fleshed out and you can make very cool bases with a variety of structures and materials.\\n\\nSo, why do I not recommend the game?\\n\\nBecause the game still feels like it's in Beta. There are bugs, items that don't work, and missing features (like geographical diversity) 3 years since the game has been released. That item you just crafted? Sorry, there's a bug that doesn't allow it to be wired to power to actually use it. Those pirates you just killed for 200,000 bounty? Sorry, the game decided not to give you the payout. Your permadeath save? How about it gets ruined when you clip out of the space station into dead space and get killed by cosmic radiation?\\n\\nRewind the clock and it was only ever worse than it is now - more bugs and less features.\\n\\nThere is a lot of content there, but it is held back by a relatively monotonous progression, game-breaking bugs, and repetitive procedural generation of landscapes. \\n\\nI respect the amount of post-launch work the NMS Team has put into their initially broken product, but it's still definitely not worth $60. Maybe worth $20 or $30 on sale if you really really love exploration of infinite worlds and long crafting recipe trees.\\n\\nNot worth a cent if you don't fall into the above categories or want a seriously exhilarating game.\",\n",

On realizing exactly how pointless this game was, it literally made me question all the time I spend on all other games, questioning whether all were, on some level, an equally pointless waste of time and money. \\n\\nThe question I kept asked myself while slogging through No Man\\'s Sky was \"why\"? Look you can explore such crazy planets! \"Why?\" Look we have lots of animals! \"Why?\" Look you can buy new spaceships! \"Why\"? Look you can build a base! \"Ok but... why?\" And the answer to all of these questions really isnt clear. Sure you can buy a bigger space ship to make more money to buy bigger space ships to make more money to buy bigger space ships but at some point, it really hits you exactly how pointless that is. \\n\\nAnd once you have a big space ship and a base and have been to half a dozen crazy planets you inevitably ask yourself, \"what\\'s actually the point?\" And while this game has unquestionably improved since it\\'s release, offering new activities and content, it\\'s failed to add the one thing it\\'s needed most since launch: A POINT! A [i]reason[/i] to play, to explore, to build, to buy, to do anything! What little \"story\" there is completely fails to keep players engaged and moving forward, and without that you\\'re left with a visually stunning waste of time. \\n\\nSo there it is.

You guys really did something pretty impressive, you fixed a lot of the issues in the game, got more stuff into it and gave it a good polish. I really appreciate the effort that the company put into it; it must be pretty tough to see a lot of  memes and people making fun about something you\\'ve created. Making this game must\\'ve been exausting and really hard, being ambicious has its price. \\nI always loved space, star wars, rockets, ships (you get the picture) and when i saw the trailer for this game, i knew it was a dream coming to reality, finally i could explore space. I pre ordered this game and played in the very first day of launch, it was clunky, REALLY bad optimized, buggy and ugly... But for some reason, the feeling of exploring, the feeling of freedom and getting out of the atmosphere to reach space and see how small you are compared to the universe, it was magic and i kept playing no man\\'s sky for many hours.\\nAlthough games are, to some extent, forms of art as George R.R Martin himself said \"Games are almost art, they\\'re getting there\" they still need some specific aspects to be considered such. These aspects relate to visuals, experience, story etc. No man\\'s sky sure has visuals, they\\'re gorgeous when you\\'re out there in space as i said, the first contact with exploring the universe was magnificent. But that\\'s it, i felt like there was always something holding me from enjoying the game in a \"contemplative\" aspect or in a exploration aspect (must be because you need to refuel your suit every 30 seconds and you can only use your landing pads 4 times before you need to refuel them again, kinda breaking the cool part of the game and being a ship pilot going wherever the fuck i want+ the sentinels are a pain in the ass and not a challenge). But then they implemented a \"creative mode\" and still i couldn\\'t immerse myself in the space adventure for some reason, it felt just superficial again. The repetitive places and gameplay aspects that were just annoying were not enough to keep me playing for endless hours.\\nBut hey, there\\'s the OTHER side of this game that is less artistic and more practical. You grind (simple as that) and i feel like all i did was to try to find a decent system with a decent RNG and start mining or crafting stuff to sell. Don\\'t get me wrong i love grinding in some games, but here\\'s the catch: you grind because you want a nice reward; or let\\'s go deeper and say that you play games because you want to feel rewarded (that\\'s why rpg games are so addictive). In all my gameplay, didn\\'t feel rewarded at all, you can disagree and say that i played it the wrong way but that\\'s the truth, the sense of reward is way too low to become addictive and making me want to play again\\ni can\\'t recommend this game, but if you REALLY LOVE space exploration, space minecraft, RNG clusterfuck and you don\\'t really care about a low sense of reward... Give it a try, you might like it. \\nIf you want a space adventure with fair challenge, depth, high sense of reward and perhaps some cool grinding then you might need to wait for such a game to come out. \\nSorry for the long text\\nHello Games don\\'t give up, You\\'re in the right way. One day, with future updates i might change my mind and remove this review and recommend this game',\n",

       "  'review': 'EDIT: Even though I gave this a thumbs down, I still voted it for the \"Labor of Love\" award since it has come so incredibly far from it\\'s launch\\n\\n[b]No Man\\'s Sky is my favorite game that I don\\'t want to play anymore.[/b]\\n\\nHow\\'s that??  I guess that needs some explanation.  This is a game of extremes.  You have an infinite universe in front of you, but there only seems like there\\'s a handful of actual planets and the rest is all just slightly randomized. [b] I love being able to explore in games, and this gives you LOTS of stuff to explore and find and do on the planet surface. It really does keep you busy for quite a long time.[/b]  That\\'s probably the best part of this game.  However, after you\\'ve seen all the major planet types, there really isn\\'t much left in the way of exploration. \\n\\nThe SPACE side of this game actually kinda sucks in my opinion.  After playing Elite Dangerous and seeing a realistic universe portrayed the way I expect it, this game comes off as hollow with their planets all crammed within 5 minutes of each other.  Then there\\'s the fact that everywhere you go, there\\'s an asteroid field.  It doesn\\'t really make sense other than \"here\\'s an easy grind for a handful of materials that\\'s hard to get otherwise\".  I go to the asteroids and shoot stuff when I need Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Tritium... I can find Gold somewhat easily on planets, and Platinum rarely, but strangely I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever found a planet with silver on it.  Platinum is pretty rare too but I\\'ve at least seen that one.\\n\\nSpeaking of Space, the combat also really blows.  I am not a fan.  Combat is a chore and it feels like you\\'re flying the ship by holding a carrot on a stick for a goat that controls which way the ship actually points.   It feels sloppy, imprecise, and generally gets in the way.  It\\'s no fun for me so I generally try to avoid combat.  It\\'s not HARD because all the enemies die pretty quickly as long as you can manage to shoot them enough times, or if you\\'ve got some backup from your freighters, but it\\'s no fun and it feels like a chore.\\n\\nThere\\'s trading to be done, but that too doesn\\'t feel like it belongs in this game, especially when you buy something and find out you have to carry it in stacks of 5 and so you can only hold 40 of them because you don\\'t have enough slots left. I should be able to fill a cargo ship with whatever I want (within reason) and sell it without worrying about hearing the dreaded \"[i]NO FREE SLOTS IN SUIT IN-VEN-TREE[/i]\".   \\n\\nI heard enough of that in the first 30 minutes of playing the game.  Highly annoying and reminiscent of those games where they fill your pockets with trash as an obstacle...mostly because they do.  Several chests you find have \"rusted metal\" that you have to put in your pockets (or ship, or exocraft, or freighter, but you MUST TAKE IT before you can throw it away) and sometimes after taking the crap metal I have to stop, throw it away and then open the chest again to get to the REAL contents.  That is not fun.  That\\'s annoying as hell. \\n\\nThen we have the story in this game.  You have to find out the lore in bits and pieces through various terminals and oracles and shrines, and talking to people and so on, and that\\'s fine I guess, but the story itself isn\\'t exactly riveting.  There\\'s actual missions you can take that advance parts of the story more directly and that\\'s not exactly riveting either.  I\\'d give the Story 3/5.  It\\'s passable at best...and that\\'s when the game works properly.\\n\\nWhile we\\'re talking about that, this game crashed a lot on me, or if it doesn\\'t crash, stuff just doesn\\'t work right.  Or if it works right, it\\'ll stop working right later for no reason.  As an example, after a long game session, I\\'ll open one of the giant inventory boxes they make you put up so you can store more junk, and I\\'ll have plenty of space for something but I\\'ll click on the item and it\\'ll tell me \"INVENTORY FULL\" in that robo-voice, and I had no idea why... but I found out.  Somehow two items get stuck into one slot but it only shows the top item.   \\n\\nExample:  I see Phosphorous in the storage, so I click on it and it tells me I can\\'t take it... I clear out as much room as possible and try to take something else, which works just fine, but then I go back for the phosphorous and lo and behold, something else jumps into the now-free slot (maybe ferrite dust? Maybe something else) and I\\'ll be thinking \"where did that stuff come from?\"  Apparently out of the 5 slots they give you per storage unit, sometimes 6 items get shoved in there and then you can\\'t take from it until room is made for the 6th item to pop out. Weird.\\n\\nThere\\'s also numerous times when quests will just screw up on me.  It\\'ll tell me to see someone to start a quest, and then upon starting it, it\\'ll immediately tell me I am done even though I did nothing and did NOT fulfill the quest at all.  Then it might hang up and not allow me to progress any further or it might just skip over something crucial and leave me wondering why everything is broken now?  There\\'s an option somewhere to restart some of these quests but it really is annoying and doesn\\'t seem to work for all quests.\\n\\nSo I can see you\\'re reading all of this and thinking \"Why the hell did you even buy this game?\"  Well, honestly, I bought it for the VR support.   This game didn\\'t interest me at all until VR and that\\'s where I started playing it and started to really enjoy the exploration aspect.  I actually spent like 6 hours in VR at a time JUST in this game, but they were pretty frustrating hours... mostly because some of the controls in VR are even worse than they are in the pancake version, but also because some stuff just flat out doesn\\'t work in VR.   \\n\\nExample: I can\\'t rename anything in VR... for a long time one of the multi-tool weapons didn\\'t work in VR (I think they fixed that now), flying a ship in VR is made more frustrating by the fact that your hands can get \"glued\" to the stick and you want to move your hand away for some reason but instead you wind up pulling hard on the stick.  I think I had to squeeze the grip again to get it to quit.  Other times I\\'m able to disengage by just moving my hand far enough away, but flying in VR is even less fun than flying on the pancake version and that\\'s really a shame.  \\n\\nSo a quick rundown for those who don\\'t want to read all of that:\\n+ Planet exploration is great (at first at least)\\n- Space exploration sucks \\n+ learning the lore and language is neat but kinda tedious (so it\\'s a bit of a negative after a while)\\n- Quests screw up all the time and if you can\\'t restart it then it may just break everything.  \\n- combat sucks in almost every form but mostly space combat....The terrestrial stuff at least sorta feels like a FPS.\\n+ VR is super neat and the best reason to own this game\\n- VR is/was/probably will always be kinda buggy and more trouble than it\\'s worth on lots of different aspects of the game\\n+ Lots of story to play through\\n- But the story isn\\'t that interesting.  You may like it but I think I spotted the \"twist\" a long time ago and it\\'s not that new or original...but keep in mind that I never finished it because ultimately (original or not) I found it rather boring.  Again, you may like it.\\n\\nThis review is a mess....but that\\'s somewhat fitting for this game which is also a hot mess.  I feel like they started off with a grand concept that was unfinished (which bit them in the ass when everyone found out), then they added on to it in ways that helped to flesh it out but don\\'t feel like they were entirely planned, or not well planned anyway.  Now years later, the game is bigger and better than it was, but the code is probably a big spaghetti tangle and pulling one thread to unravel a bug knots 3 more in its wake.\\n\\nIf you have a lot of free time and patience and you don\\'t mind a sub-par story, but you love base building, and playing online with friends, this might still be worth it for you, but it\\'s not for me.  Sorry folks',\n",

       "  'review': 'I loved this game i really did. I was super hype for the big update they released last year. Me and a friend woke up super early to download and play the update. This new update, has absolutely destroyed the stability of the game and over a month after launch its still broken for me and my friends. I understand for some they game has been fixed, and we all know when this update came out it REALLY screwed the game up. \\nHowever on my end and my friends ends, the game is literally unplayable. I cant even begin to go into details on what is wrong but i can simplify it to constant falling through stations, crashes, poor performance, constant glitches and bugs, ETC. I dont mind the game getting updated and wiping my save everytime, i dont mind the fact its still being developed and will have some issues. I dont mind when my game crashes from time to time. I do mind where its at the point where i literally cannot play the game anymore.\\nI dont suggest this game for that reason alone that you could be one of the people who buy this, boot it up, and realize your game is also broken and it cannot be played. I applaud the developers still updating this game and what they have added is nothing short of amazing. They truly are putting everything into this. I hope that it is fixed someday because id love to play this again.',\n",

       "  'review': 'My heart races as I anticipate exploring the next planet in the next solar system in the vast universe. How long will they make me fly in a straight line this time before I am plunged into the next warp screen opening a canvas to the next breathtaking barren world filled with colossal amounts of empty space? What color will the wasteland be this time? Will I finally stumble across the purple watered, blue landed paradise filled with flying spiders and giraffe rabbits? How many dozens of warp screens will I watch before the time I spent watching them equals the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy and all of the special features? Its questions like these that make me feel like the heroic explorers of the past and allow me to ponder of the infinite possibilities of what I could have done with all the time spent watching those numerous warp screens.\\n\\nI loved walking slowly to my ship and flying through a warp load screen off planet then flying into a space station with a docking cut scene while I slowly walked to the teleporter in the space station for a warp load screen in space to get to my space base to stash supplies very slowly into my extremely limited inventory space so that I could slowly walk back to the teleporter on my space base and warp load screen back to the space station to sell slowly sell off my very limited inventory space for space units in a space merchant system designed by the same psychotic people who patented robot telemarketing and the space between your car seat and center console big enough for change and phones to fall into, but not big enough for a hand to fit into.\\n\\n Afterwards I fondly remember slowly teleporting from station to station to station, always greeted by the familiar comfort of the LSD infused warp screen, to go from one stereotype alien to the next and dredge through their merchant page to slowly spend my space units on upgrades, weapons, and the materials needed to explore deeper into this vast world of loading screens. \\n\\nMy pupils involuntarily dilate at the thought of continuing the adventure of exploring the planets ranging from any of the colors from the 64 color box of Crayola crayons and exploiting them for resources. The adrenaline pumping actions of squeezing my left mouse button down as the laser from my space laser very very very slowly extracts minerals from trees and rocks to trees that look like rocks so that I can slowly fill my very very very limited inventory space before I slowly walk back to my ship and fly through a warp screen to a space station and watch my favorite docking sequence and.....well....I think you the reader can guess what happens next ;-). \\n\\nNo Man\\'s Sky is truly an introspective game that lets you discover yourself and feel the energy of the universe flow through you. I loved how the developers really made an effort to make the player sit through warp screens at every possible occasion to give you time to make you wonder things like: \"what am I doing with my life?\" \"Why am I doing this?\" \"why do I exist?\" \"what does it all mean?\" \\n\\nIf I could go back in time, to a time before I played No Man\\'s Sky, I would probably die instantly from having to watch 1 more space loading screen from going back in time. \\n\\nDon\\'t ever play this game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"(note: I do not play multiplayer, nor do I play in VR)\\n\\nNo Man's Sky tries to do everything, but is shallow in every aspect. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE.\\n\\nExploration: The first several planets are interesting with weird animals and plants. After visiting a dozen planets, you'll find that they are mostly the same. All radioactive planets have the same aesthetics; all frozen planets have he same kind of trees; all toxic planets are inhabited by the same type of flora. And because there are only several type of planets, you'll find this 'sameness' show up very quickly. The type of fauna is quite limited as well. After five to ten planets, you'll see animals repeat over and over. For a game supposedly about exploring an 'infinite' universe, it's a huge weakness. And there's a thing that grates me and a lot of people: plants and animals pop in right in front of you, appearing out of thin air and instantly ending your suspension of disbelief. It somehow got far worse in the newest update.\\n\\nCreature interaction: You can ride creatures or gain their food products after feeding them. The novelty will fade off pretty quickly. You can't keep them as pets; they'll despawn if you move far away from them.\\n\\nResource management: It only serves to interfere with the 'exploration' aspect of the game. Gathering resources involves standing there shooting a beam at rocks and plants, which is boring as heck. Why do you need to gather resources in an 'exploration' game? Because you'll need them to recharge your hazard protection unit, life support, starship engine and warping system. It's not a challenge; you become kind of immortal after 10 minutes of gameplay (unless you are careless of course). But it forces you to constantly pause your exploration and fiddle with those sodium, oxygen, di-hydrogen, etc.\\n\\nInventory management: The most important gameplay loop of No Man's Sky is not exploring planets; it's expanding the inventory of your exosuit to reduce the tedium of resource management. But it is itself tedious. You expand your inventory by visiting space stations and ground based 'drop pods'. The former can only be used once per star system, forcing you to warp to a lot of systems; the latter requires an expensive item to even be found, after which asks you to gather a lot of resources before being usable. And you'll need to do this tedious task EIGHTY-THREE times before having a full inventory!\\n\\nStarships: They are functionally the same. They may look different but even your starting ship can do everything a high level ship can do (space combat, flying from to planets, from system to system, etc. ). The only difference is the number of inventory slots.\\n\\nSentient Aliens: They inhabit the whole universe for some untold reason; their buildings scatter around almost every planet, but cities are weirdly absent. There are three cliched races: traders, explorers and warriors, which you see in every sci-fi work. They supposedly have a rich and turbulent history, but your interactions with them do not reflect this, save for some cliched lore text dump.\\n\\nCombat: You fight two types of enemies: ground based sentinels and space pirates. They're basically about who has higher DPS. There is no nuanced strategy. You stand there (or sit in your spaceship) and shoot at the enemies until they die.\\n\\nBase building: It's acceptable, but nowhere as good as in Minecraft. To access base parts you need hundreds of 'salvaged data' which are scattered around surfaces of planets and take up dozens of hours to gather, before you can do anything meaningful in construction. The customization possibility is low because you only use prefabs, not blocks like in Minecraft.\\nThey recently introduced a power system. Again, it's rudimentary, far worst than the Minecraft redstone system. A big functioning base require a huge amounts of solar panels, which interferes with the aesthetics of big bases. \\n\\nFreighters and frigates: You can build a mobile base on your own freighter, but it's as shallow as ground-based base building. You can send out frigates to do missions, but the planning you do is absolutely minimal. You can't decide which star system to go, which planet to explore. It's as exciting as watching paint dry.\\n\\nStory missions: Completely lack depth. You go somewhere, interact with someone while looking at some text lore, do something (like gathering x amount of resources or killing x enemies) at their request, and report back to them. The presentation and content is so bad that I do not care about the protagonists at all.\\n\\nCooking: The newest update introduced cooking, which is fine. But what do you do with those finished foods? You either eat them to recharge your life support or give them to an NPC for some currency. You can't even put them as items into your own base!\\n\\nAnd last but not least: Bugs and performance!\\nOh man, the bugs in this game are numerous and never-ending. The developers seem to have a talent of introducing bugs with every major update. The performance of the game is absolutely horrendous.\\nYou can clip through freighters making you suspended in outer space, forcing you to reload.\\nFeeding creatures can crash the game.\\nFPS drop to 10-15 in small bases; it gets even lower in large bases.\\n\\nOnce again, do not buy this shallow game. You'll regret it.\\nIf you want a survival/crafting game, get Subnautica.\\nIf you want a game about construction and creativity, get Minecraft.\\nIf you want a game about exploration, combat and story, get the Witcher III.\\nDO NOT BUY NO MAN'S SKY.\",\n",

The creatures are on a template, so you see the same types of creatures on every planet (no giant spiders, etc).  The plants are templates as well, and you will see similar rocks, plants, etc on every single planet you visit.\\n\\nWorst of all, the worlds always feel dead.  Even the vibrant \"alive and abundant\" worlds have at max 20 creature variation and rarely all at the same time.  You will never find any animal behaviors, either.  No drinking water or eating foliage for these animals.   Even the predators will chase you for miles, trailing 10-20 of them while they run past a delicious dinner in pursuit of me.

It has a brilliant core concept that was executed brilliantly... but then much of everything else is just mediocre at best. It lacks polish and refinement, and it desperately lacks bug-fixing. The UI is a horrid holdover from appliance-type hardware that can no longer even play the game well, and there are far too many WTF! moments with unexpected or unintuitive mechanics, like building blocks that don\\'t fit together seamlessly.  Planetary exploration is a lie, because the motivation for exploration is to DOCUMENT what is discovered and be able to RETURN to those discoveries.  Neither the documenting nor the returning is possible in this game, because all mapping and cartography tools have been denied the player, even those available to a 15th Century explorer.  Every visit to a planet is playing a blindfolded game of pin the tail on the donkey.\\n\\nWas Hello Games\\' ill-advised obsession with adding multiplayer gameplay directly responsible, or is Hello Games just irresponsible with the \"chore\" of bug-fixing and refining the game mechanics to evolve it from mediocre to excellent?  Whatever the reason or excuse, this game consistently leaves players wanting much more than it delivers, and who desperately want to love the game but wind up hating \"all the little things\" that aggravate them as they play.\\n\\nWith regard to the belated addition of multiplayer features, ask yourself this: does \"making it a threesome\" ever really fix a bad marriage?  No.  The underlying faults and issues are still there.  Such it is with this game; the faults and mediocre gameplay are still there, unresolved and unrefined, and sharing that mediocre gameplay with others doesn\\'t make it less mediocre.',\n",

Apparently I shouldn\\'t have spoken to this one \\n\\n- If your friend finishes a quest in multiplayer, your quest can become impossible to finish.\\n\\n- Multiplayer going randomly out of sync. You are on the same planet with your friends, but cannot see each other. Only solution is to relog. <- this happened every hour or so',\n",

It is constant and ruins immersion. Other bugs and CTDs which have suddenly started cropping up regularly have also badly affected the experience.\\n\\nI had enjoyed this game and played it heavily for a few months and could see myself returning to it occasionally for a few hours here and there.

Having to use the awful survey visor to find power then building generators and ugly wires ruins the casual fun of base building before the update. Underwater base building is fun for a moment until you realize that every ocean on every planet is quite shallow and the same. \\n\\nThe Nexus part of Beyond showed promise of a more interesting multiplayer, but did not truly add anything significant. Playing with friends remains just building bases or flying near each other with very little interaction. \\n\\nOverall I wont deny that they have built a massive array of galaxies, fauna, and flora but the novelty wears thin quickly.

That kind of instability could have been excusable for the first year, but it's three years later and I'm getting bugs that I could have sworn were solved years ago.\\n\\nEven if you can get past the general atmosphere of instability, VR is so disappointing. Not that it's inherently bad, but that it could be so much better. Loading up the game in VR might make your controllers disappear, button prompts vanish, or nothing might happen at all as HG didn't set default controls. When it works, it makes all the bugs feel so much worse as you'll see what the game could be and what HG sorta wants. And when it doesn't work, you'll just feel heartbroken as you watch your prized ship vibrate back and forth before exploding.\\n\\nOverall, I've spent over 75 hours in the game. It's obvious that I enjoyed it enough to keep playing, but when I think back, I can't figure out why I spent so much time here instead of playing anything else.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This game had so much hype in the beginning with all these different planets, space combat/cool flying, interesting npcs and the multiplayer. And then, DELAYED and no beta copies hmmmmmm something is weird. alright alright some bug fixes and some more polishing i trust you and the omega ship nice looks cool i can wait. \\nAugust: man this game is going to blow my mind fill me in with this amazing gameplay hello games\\nIn Game: OKAY where is my omega ship *progresses through story and gets better ship* notices that my omega ship is on the planet and its is garbage. *later* I get stuck on a baron planet for 20 minutes walking for a way out and then i realize this game sucks\\nBad flying, horrible combat, npcs suck,  NO MULTIPLAYER and the storyline and its ending sucked.\\n\\nfastfowarding to the newest update BEYOND: ok they added big stuff and in the end of it all the time i waited for them to knock my socks off\\nI lost all respect for the game. I like playing time consuming games but this i just could not spend enough time to stay attached. npcs are still bad, I hate the story, and what is the point in doing all this, its not worth 60$ before or now, it has been three years and my disappointment is so high that it took them to fulfill their promises and still charge at a non sale time for 60$',\n",

       "  'review': 'Straight to the point review, seems great at first with loads of potential with excitement of whats to come. Besides the big hype for all of these \"MAJOR UPDATES\" there isn\\'t that much to do other than grind and build a bases and upgrade your ship with many bugs constantly ruining it such as falling through the floor and some game breaking bugs.\\n\\nFor detailed breakdown.\\n\\n20 hours in, find all you\\'re really doing is grinding like an mmo but unlike something such as world of warcraft you dont get the reward of using the gear you grind for to raid with friends etc but you hope something is going to come from it and its building upto something. Also as mentioned above there are many bugs that make the experience very frustrating.\\n\\n\\n30 hours in - Find out there isnt really any real challenge its just about grinding and progressively getting more material to get better equipment so you guessed it. You can grind for even more.\\n\\n40 hours in - Repeat of the previous but finally bored of it and realise nothing is actually coming from the grinding may aswell waste my time doing it on an mmo as at least can do that with friends. There is multiplayer on no mans sky but its basically like youre both playing your own single player game and doing very little together as you can\\'t build bases together or use each others ships and most quests are done solo.\\n\\nThe most unique thing I found in this game is that sh*t is called faecium and is an element you can sellwhich I found amusing. Without spoiling the ending to the game (which is the main reason I stopped after a friend told me and I lookedi nto it to confirm)\\nWill likely make you think its the most retarded ending to a game youve ever known as without spoling it undoes alot of your hard work so you can you\\'ve guessed it grind even more.\\n\\nI rate this 3 out of 10 faecium',\n",

There\\'s no part in this game what can be considered any kind of \\'good\\'. \\n\\n[h1]It\\'s poorly done.[/h1]\\nIt have a hint of three billion different gameplay mechanics, and none of them is developed to any sorts of depth. They just stays as a hints. Like you playing early alpha or something. And that\\'s after few major updates!\\n\\n[h1]The Universe[/h1]\\nIt promises endless universe with billions of solar systems... But they all the same. After you visit 10 or so planets - you\\'ll get bored. There would be hills with randomly scattered mineral nodes and tries. \\n\\n[h1]Planetary exploration[/h1]\\nEvery planet have exactly ONE biome. From pole to equator and back to pole again - every planet would look exactly the same as the place where you first landed. And there is less then 10 noticeably distinct types of planets.\\nOn most of the planets - there\\'s buildings. And, as you might have guess, there\\'s about 10-15 distinct planetary structures. Throughout whole universe, yes, not just the planet. All of them - standalone structures, just scattered randomly. No cities, no infrastructure - just random buildings in the middle of the great nowhere. Almost all planets have almost all types of structures on them.\\n\\n[h1]Ground Combat[/h1]\\nIs... boring. On every planet there\\'s Sentinels. 4 types of them. Yes, 4 types throughout the endless Universe. It\\'s a Drone, Armored Drone, Doggo and a Walker. They come in waves and after you defeat  one wave, in a less then a minute game will spawn next, stronger wave. After you defeat strongest wave... it will spawn it again. Ad infinitum. And yeah, \"strongest\" means two armored drones, two doggos and a walker. After you get hang of it, defeating them is not a really big deal. Just annoying. When you tired of fighting you could always jump into your spaceship and zip away. There would be no consequences. Oh you could hide in the burrow, they will search you for a minute and then forgot what you ever existed.\\nThere\\'s also Zerg-like creatures, what pose a bit of threat, but you could notice their nest from a mile and they never attack unprovoked. Yeah.\\nAnd even if you die... You\\'ll be respawned at your starship, which is probably parked fifty to two hundred meters away. Because the\\'s no any sensible way to get to that location without your spaceship in the first place. That\\'s HARDCORE, man.\\n\\n[h1]Space Combat[/h1]\\nEven more boring. And more annoying, because here you\\'ll get attacked from time to time and could not escape before killing everyone. Also, you could recharge your shield for resources and for kills, and your opponent does not have any shields at all. I never died in space. Your HUD is also super useless, so you fight in 3D almost blind. But more on that later.\\n\\n[h1]Resources[/h1]\\nThere\\'s gazillion different resources, and most of them - useless. They exist just craft one or two things which you probably never ever would craft in the first place. because they are also useless. It would\\'t be such a big issue, but you have extremely limited inventory space. And you have no way of telling, which resources are essential and which is just a garbage. Because it\\'s so inconsistent.\\n\\n[h1]Chemistry[/h1]\\nAt first it just leave bad taste in my mouth but then then it became epiphany. It\\'s just describes whole game/ It\\'s so inconsistent, it makes your brain hurt, it\\'s dead wrong and it\\'s weird.\\nFirst of all, it\\'s called \\'refining\\'. And it starts as a quite promising feature, but goes sour really fast.\\nYou have qute a few elements. Things like Oxygen, Nitrogen, Radon, Cobalt, Carbon, Tritium... Each one of them have a corresponding symbol from periodic table. GOOD. But most corresponding resource icons have some variation of generic pop-culture image of an atom, from the guy, who never had a chemistry class in his life. Just bad attention to details, you say. It is. But it gets worse.\\n\\nIron called \"Ferrite\". Why? \\n\\nHydrogen called Di-hydrogen. Why?! Why there isn\\'t things like di-oxygen, di-nitrogen then? All those gases prefer to exist in di-form. Which means what they are naturally forms molecules like H2, O2 and N2, correspondingly. Also, this di-hydrogen have an icon what better suited for deuterium. But they have deuterium. And it have an icon of two di-hydrogen \\'thingies\\'. AAAAAH! Awesome level of scientific literacy for Sci-Fi game. Yet the Tritium have an icon which is acceptable for Tritium. Consistency!\\n\\nCarbon Dioxide called Dioxite. What. Yes. This word does\\'t even exist, and they have lots of fictional compounds, but they choose to slap CO2 formula on it. WHY?!\\n\\nBut it\\'s get worse.\\n\\nBecause there\\'s...\\n\\n[h1]Refining[/h1]\\nIt called refining, but in fact it\\'s transmutations. Things are completely unpredictable there. It follows no logic, it makes no sense.\\n\\nOkay, you get Ferrite, you combine it with Oxygen, and you get... Rusted Metal. Fair enough.\\nNow, equipped with this knowledge you take Oxygen, combine it with Hydrogen and you get... Yeah, you guessed it, Sodium Chloride. You still with me? Breathe.\\nOkay, now it\\'s a bit easier. \\nYou could refine Sodium Chloride into Chlorine gas. Fine. Sodium is much more valuable resource in the game, but okay.\\nBut now you could combine Chlorine with Oxygen. And no, there\\'s no chlorine oxides in the game, thankfully.\\nFor one unit of Chlorine and two units of Oxygen you\\'ll get... bear with me... six units of Chlorine. Yes. You quite literally creating things from thin air here.\\nAnt everything is like that. You need carbon nanotubes to make microprocessors. WHY?! What carbon ever have to do with microprocessors? \\nTo make Circuit Board you need bunch of fruits what you could reliably get in desired quantities only from really extensive farming.\\nJust... NO. God. Ugh.\\n\\n[h1]Interface and Navigation[/h1]\\nI could continue on, and on, and on. Every, and i mean it, EVERY gameplay mechanic there ether broken or so shallow and undeveloped, it have no right to be in a finished product. But i guess I said more then enough already.\\nBut this thing have to be addressed.\\nThe interface in the game there just to annoy hell out of you.\\nThere is no map.\\nThere is no planetary maps.\\nThere is no solar system maps.\\nThere is no galaxy map. Last one not exactly true, but call this assortment of random nondescript dots a map is also a bit of stretch.\\nNavball in your starship is all but useless on a planet. In space it\\'s pretty much useless as well. And that\\'s the only navigation tool you have. Enjoy.\\nIt seems like there\\'s no way to look around inside your cockpit without VR-set. And in some cockpits navball and information screen just outside of your field of view. Enjoy.\\nYou cannot call the other ships. If you want to communicate, you should get close to that ship and wait for them to call you. Neat.\\n\\nBut i saved my favorite for the last.\\nYou could exchange navigational data for planetary chart on a space station. It\\'s the one of few ways to navigate on a planets. Well, \"navigate\". Planetary chart will point you nearest random building on a planet, so you could participate in some random encounter. Yes, it\\'s as useless as it sounds.\\nSo to obtain a planetary chart you should first obtain some nav-data. It\\'s not a problem, it\\'s everywhere, but it takes your precious inventory space.\\nSo, you at cartographer.\\n[olist]\\n[*]Start conversation with a cartographer\\n[*]Listen to his greeting message\\n[*]Wait for dialog options to appear\\n[*]Choose according dialog option\\n[*]Listen to his lengthy reply\\n[*]Wait for the game to return controls to you \\n[/olist]\\nCongratulations, you just exchanged ONE nav-data for ONE chart. Oh, you want two charts? Do it all over again. You want 5? You don\\'t want that, trust me.\\nBut there is an icing for a cake. There\\'s multiple flavors of charts. And there\\'s no way to know in advance which type of charts this cartographer provides.',\n",

       "  'review': 'After 3,500 hours of playing the game since Foundation (don\\'t worry! 2,500 of them is AFK farming during Atlas Rises. I have a life!), I can say I\\'ve quite enjoyed it for the most part, with the definition of most being 50.000000000000000000000000000001% of the time. And usually that\\'s doing relaxing walks on my home planet.\\nBut there are really, really annoying and aggravating things that prevent me from recommending the game just yet. Mainly the nerfed exploration (BIG ONE), the frustrating base building, those damn sentinels, the little things and the TONS of damage, I mean BUGS.\\n\\n1 - There are just TEN different kinds of terrain generation in a game with quintillions of planets, and each planet/moon can have just ONE. This is fine before NEXT when the landscapes can get really magnificent, but NEXT made it feel rather same-y after just a few planets or moons. Why not combine two or more of them for more variation? Same thing with the biomes too. Some planets can have just one terrain or biome while others can have two or more. Or maybe bring back the old terrain generation to some planets. (City planets or planets with village-like settlements please, though that\\'s probably just a dream hahahaha)\\n\\n2 - Colors are seriously nerfed. Not counting the mega-exotic planets, there are just 6 sky colors. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, pink. There are just 4 colors of water - Red, yellow, green and blue. In lush planets, there just 7. Red, yellow, brown, blue, green, violet, pink. Maybe 8 with the rare white grass. How about using more (like way more) color combinations so all planets will feel more unique?\\n\\n3 - Flora and fauna levels. What happened to this? Before NEXT, planets have varying levels of flora and fauna. I used to see planets that have barely any flora but lots of fauna, while others are lush forests with no fauna. No noise. Just peace and quiet in that planet. Now, all non-dead planets have lots of flora - the variety is dramatically lessened. Why!\\n\\n4 - I\\'m seeing almost, if not the same kind of fauna in almost every planet/moon I come across. It was a bit more varied before NEXT. Out of the several hundred, probably over a thousand planets I\\'ve explored, 95% of it have the same cow-like, rat-like, dog-like whatever creatures. It gets old real quick. The noises need to be more varied as well. It\\'s the same set of animal noises for every fauna. The same. The birds and flying worms don\\'t make a sound either. Just a dream: Bring back the sandworm.\\n\\n5 - I don\\'t know why, but building a base, especially larger ones, is FRUSTRATING. To me, it\\'s not the power system - I\\'m probably in the minority that likes it. It is how annoying and sometimes, difficult it is to place base parts. Some even require multiple weird steps to make, like stair \"railings\". Others will be \"invalid\" or something due to Atlas knows what. The ability to minutely rotate objects with the mouse wheel is also lost. Can\\'t just everything snap easy-peasy and validly so we can more easily build stuff. We can easily delete a wrongly placed floor tile or wall, instead of dealing with the annoying invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid invalid oh my goodness why is the wall having a seizure invalid invalid invalid invalid everything? Or maybe add an angle-adjusting function so we won\\'t resort to glitch building all the time?\\n\\n6 - Sentinels. These things are A PLAGUE, those drones especially that make annoying machine sounds that vaguely resemble evil laughter. Just mining a tiny 1 yoctometer-sized rock alerts them. Their AI and the manner they spawn both seriously need reworks as they are a manifestation of annoyance. A REAL ANNOYANCE SO ANNOYING, EVEN YERSINIA PESTIS IS SCARED OF BEING ANNOYED AND PESTERED BY THEM PESTS. Sure I can just keep distance and watch them stupidly wonder what the heck is going on, but a lot of times, especially in survival mode, THEY JUST APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU WHILE DESTROYING TINY ROCKS WHICH MAKES THEM MAD AND GO PEW PEW.\\n\\n7 - Bugs. In the Beyond update, there are so many bugs, it\\'s insane. Why does every update, especially the big ones, have to be infested with colonies of bugs? Considering how huge the game is, updates having several bugs is fine. It can take a patch or 5 to fix. But several colonies of bugs? Some of which are so darn persistent they reincarnate to a different bug when they die? Err... what\\'s going on? Why release updates in such a bug-infested state?\\n\\n8 - The little things. OH BOY there are a lot here. When firing your weapon, instead of instant response, sometimes the avatar will twitch the gun for a second before firing, even if the weapon is already drawn. This has screwed me many times in intense battles against sentinel walkers and quads. Ship handling can still get unpredictable and twitchy, even in fighters with a full suite of S-class pulse engine upgrades. Pirates asking for just 10,000 units even if I have 200 Stasis Devices (worth about 3 billion units) in my starship. Enemy starships going through freighters. Pulse jumping to the rear of my freighter, only to clip through the engines and get stuck. Not getting any damage from Biologial Horrors as long as I hug the outside of an abandoned building\\'s wall, but I hope I won\\'t get clipped through or else I\\'ll reload my save and start collecting eggs again! Biological Horror spit dealing not that much damage. Lack of really powerful enemies, especially to players with S-class everything. Hostile fauna going through plants and birds and rocks and things when they want to eat me. Large refiners having portable capacity (250). Ceiling lights and floor lamps emit almost zero light. Not being able to swap items unless there is an empty slot. Why can\\'t I place a table in my base unless it\\'s the planet surface? Why are my base specialists\\' feet below the floor? Why is the wall invalid and having a seizure while building a base? Why is my FPS being flushed down the toilet as I\\'m flushing down myself and my starship down to the planet\\'s surface? The clouds don\\'t look as awesome as the one in the NEXT trailer. Why does every system have a ringed planet? Why do star systems always need to have life? I encountered star systems with nothing but dead planets in the past. I can\\'t evenly flatten the terrain with the terrain manipulator - I can just make holes or fill holes and hope that it is at least semi-flat. That small cutscene when using a manufacturing plant\\'s save thingy. Planet-wide storms occurring at regular intervals. Pirates attacking at regular intervals. Getting attacked by pirates in a supposedly uncharted system. My underground base being covered by terrain... yeah. Quite a lot and there\\'s more! But that\\'s what I have in mind right now. Anyways!\\n\\nAt its current state, even after playing the game for 3,500 hours, I still can\\'t recommend the game just yet. It still needs a lot more polish, tons more bug fixing, quality of life improvements and most especially, doing something about the exploration aspect. If Hello Games can at least nail the exploration aspect and call the most ruthless and merciless bug exterminator in existence, most of the more minor flaws, quirks and features will be set aside by most players. I wouldn\\'t mind a full-blown reset if that\\'s what it takes to get the exploration part right. And the bugs. They need to die.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my long \"review\" of the game!',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’m a sucker for these survival-craft-explore loop games, so I’ve been a sinking time into No Man’s Sky. It’s been a really mediocre experience through a supremely boring universe.\\n\\nTo be fair, I haven’t had an expressly terrible time in No Man’s Sky. It’s been alright. I keep booting the game up and bouncing around in space and from planet to planet, scanning procedurally-generated flora and fauna, shooting a mining laser to gain resources, and occasionally fighting pirates. I don’t really know why, because none of these activities are too fun. \\n\\nThe game feels almost really good, which is tragic.

I looked back through the past few years of updates, and they’re definitely trying to flesh it out.\\n\\nThe problem is, it feels like I’m playing an MMO near the end of my subscription, going through the motions for no apparent reason, everything feeling incredibly repetitive. There’s no substance here, and the worst aspects of procedural generation are on display here. I can’t find much to praise. But, for whatever reason, I keep playing, because it’s an alright podcast game.\\n',\n",

Sadly that is not the case.\\n\\nWithin the first few minutes I experienced gameplay hampering bugs (like mining things not finishing unless you melee them, graphical issues).  Nothing too game breaking so I continued on.\\n\\nToday I lost 4 hours of progress due to a combination of bugs: I fell through the floor of a freighter which killed me somewhere in the middle of space.  After respawning, I couldn't get my grave or any of my inventory - it just bounced off of my ship.  My last manual save was 4 hours earlier - the last time I was near a save beacon.\\n\\nAs I paid full price, I wish I still qualified for a refund.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Still so broken! There is no logic to so much of it. Inventory management is so frustrating it has made me quit several times. Why does information only stack up to 5 and take up as much space as 10000 units of copper? In what universe does gold refine into pyrite FFS? There are so many items and resources that are needed in the beginning, yet they only give you a handful of \"slots\" to put them in.\\n\\nI was excited to find a new ship with much more storage, but then for some reason the ship I had just disappeared with all the resources on it I needed to fix the new one. How does a ship just disappear? I flew the thing there, but now it\\'s gone? So broken. So I\\'m stuck on a planet now with no way to fly out and get the resources I need to fix it.\\n\\nYou \"learn\" new alien languages by speaking to them one at a time and you get to learn one word from each. The process is painfully clunky, with unintelligable text scrolling ever so slowly that you have to click through again and again before you get the option to learn a random word like \"the\". So next time you speak to an alien of that race, it will be \"Blah blah blah the blah blah\". So helpful.\\n\\nThe combat is a joke. Your weapon lags and doesn\\'t fire often, the mobs are impossible to line up, aiming is a pain, but thankfully the mobs are unintelligent and even while bumping against your head they can\\'t seem to find you often. I\\'ll check in with this game again I guess when the next patch comes out to see if it has been fixed, but in the state it is in, calling it a beta would be generous.

       "  'review': 'I\\'m going to be blunt, this game is boring. \\n\\n\"At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos.\"\\n\\nTo me it was [i]very[/i] resistable. I didn\\'t care for the missing pilot, I just wanted his ship. I dont care about those people in the thing that just showed up, I just saw a cool looking planet. I didn\\'t feel like my character had a reason to do anything the game wanted me to do, except for refilling my hazard protection to survive. The NPC\\'s told me what to do, the little computer on my back told me where to go, oblivious to my wants and needs. Some parts of it made me curious, like the time I found some ruins on a planet and dug them out to receive some piece of treasure that\\'s only purpose was to be sold. Wasn\\'t some ceremonial item from civilizations passed, just something to make a space-buck.\\n\\nAll you\\'ll be doing, at the game\\'s core, is mining materials. It doesn\\'t matter [i]why[/i] you\\'re shooting that rock, you just know that it has what you need inside of it and you\\'ll be damned if you don\\'t get any of it. Then you get a bigger laser that lets you remove materials that your mining laser can\\'t. And when you\\'re out in space and not going to another planet or one of the similar-to-the-last-systems space stations or fleets, you\\'ll be shooting--you guessed it--, asteroids.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\" Yeah this isn\\'t true. I\\'ve see the same rocks on planets that are impossibly far apart, the only thing different being their stats that are only available when you scan something. My friend has commented several times about how he \"has the same animal on my planet!\" while walking past the same cave-plants I\\'ve seen in the last four planet\\'s caves.\\n\\nThe menus.. I don\\'t like it. I feel like it could have been done differently, and using right-click to go back on everything feels unintuitive, even with the icon telling me to right-click to go back, I still hit ESC and end up pausing the game. Maybe I\\'m just \\'special\\' in this aspect. I\\'m also not a fan of how things move along and opposite of my mouse when in the menus. I just don\\'t like it in games that have it, it doesn\\'t make the menu more interesting, just makes it harder to hit the buttons. Destiny also has this and I dislike it there, too. \\n\\nThe part I was most excited for was learning the languages. I was hoping I could discover various ruins of the different races, learn each of their varied pasts, actually [i]study them[/i].. Instead I get to look for cylinders with circles in them for [i]each[/i] race. Yep, each race stores their memories in the exact same obsidian blocks as the other races. I tried to like what they did where you could do different things in the memory, but it\\'s pretty much a \"yes\" or \"no\". All of the horrible things that happen to you are just visions, and the only option you should pick is \"wait it out\". \\n\\nNow you DO get to play with your friends now, and I\\'ll say the process is (mostly) smooth. Sometimes things don\\'t appear, occasionally trading doesn\\'t work, but the rest of the time it\\'s buttery smooth and I\\'ll say this game is definitely better with another person.\\n\\nShort and Sweet Version:\\n\\nYou\\'ll quickly see everything in the first couple of hours, you\\'ll be doing a lot of mining, and it\\'s almost tolerable with a friend.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I respect the hell out of what Hello Games has done to improve the state of this game. I played it at launch, and I played it again any time a major expansion released and each time it has gotten better and better. In its current state, there is much more to do, there are places to explore and a storyline to follow, and a \"point\" to gathering all of the materials: base building, upgrades, and more. For that, it is commendable - and I certainly appreciate a new space VR game to take some time out of Elite. \\n\\nBut this is still not a game that I can recommend. Hello Games has addressed the problem of there being nothing to do in the game but have failed to fix basic issues that keep turning me away from the game each time that I come back to it. These include: \\n\\n[list]\\n    [*] [b]Terrain pop-in.[/b] A game as massive as this will need to manage draw distance in some way, I understand that. What I cannot forgive is mountains and trees that change shape drastically several times as I fly toward them, or even worse appear out of thin air giving me no time to crash into them. Which leads me directly into: \\n    [*] [b]The wishy-washy flight model.[/b] Ships fishtail around in the sky and don\\'t differ meaningfully from each other in terms of handling, acceleration and features. Ships auto-accelerate and never fully stop, making it difficult to perform precise maneuvers. The game also babies you and tries its best to not let you crash into terrain. You have to be so precise with your aim in space combat that it is almost impossible to line up shots in a consistent manner. It just [i]doesn\\'t feel good[/i] to be in my spaceship in this game, whether in first or third-person view and in a game that is ostensibly about exploring the universe, this is unforgivable. To be clear: I don\\'t want Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen levels of realism in the flight model but I want to do ill-advised stunts through archways in the terrain, and juke enemies in an asteroid field and I want to do it all in a ship that feels responsive and accurate. \\n    [*] [b]The Color Palette and planet generation.[/b] Very, [i]very[/i] few planets that I have come across thus far have been interesting. Sure, there are neat plants and things to explore but 9/10 planets feel drab, lifeless, and marred by drastic color contrasts or uninteresting palettes. In the game I recently started, I went to a Red Planet, a Pink Planet, a Beige Planet, a Green Planet, another Red Planet, and finally another Beige Planet. None of them offered landscapes that were particularly interesting. Nothing I wanted to build a base on let alone explore for more than a few minutes to find the resources I need, and then get back off. Combined with the pop-in issues and generally unimpressive effects, textures and lighting I don\\'t ever want to remain planetside for longer than I have to. \\n    [*] [b]Performance Issues.[/b] My rig is running a Ryzen 3900X and a 2080 Ti with 16 GB of RAM. There should not be performance issues and yet when interacting with Knowledge Stones, entering atmospheres and at random points throughout the game I experience stutter, missed inputs and general frame drops. This isn\\'t in VR, it\\'s not in 4K, and my system usage isn\\'t maxing out when this happens either. \\n    [*] [b] Inventory Management.[/b] My God almighty this is unimpressive. The layout of your... what is it... six? seven maybe? separate inventories/technology layouts is unintelligible, clunky and difficult to manage on a controller. Simple as that, it\\'s bad. There have been updates addressing the most common QoL complaints but it needs a revamp from the bottom up to keep up with all the upgrades, separate materials and crafting components. It\\'s way too small and way too hard to manage. \\n[/list]\\n\\nI will keep coming back to No Man\\'s Sky every time there is an update. I really want this game to be great. I share Hello Games\\' vision of a \"Chill exploration experience,\" letting off steam laid back with my controller or with my headset captaining a ship through an exotic, surreal galaxy. But it cannot be [i]chill[/i] if I\\'m constantly managing my inventory. I don\\'t want to [i]explore[/i] when every planet is uninteresting and graphical glitches abound. And it\\'s not a good [i]experience[/i] when I don\\'t enjoy flying in my spaceship or dealing with performance issues. \\n\\nThis game is worth keeping up with, and not worth giving up on. I don\\'t think I ever will. I am impressed by how far it has come and am just waiting for that last extra step before I will enjoy it.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[b]Alright lets be honest here...[/b]\\nThe game has a great concept but the execution of it is less than stellar.\\n\\n[b]TLDR:\\nThe game is a great concept with poor execution. A game full of bugs, shallow story, shallow missions, shallow mechanics etc. It feels like an empty husk that looks cool from the outside.\\nI had fun with it but only because I had friends on discord to hang with while we playing it in separate instances because Multiplayer is a mess. The money and ship grind is the main time sink.[/b]\\n\\n\\nI played this game quite a while after the initial release and I had fun and now with the VR release I played it again at first it was fun but after a while you realize that all planets look very similar if not the same. \\nAlmost every single planet i went to had the oxygen plants that puff out toxic air and they had the cave rocks that also put out toxic air and not to mention the venus fly trap plant that hits you when you're not even close to it. \\nAll planets have the same looking buildings with the same looking aliens in them that say the same thing over and over. It's like taking to a kid that can only say 3 sentences.\\nAll trees look the same with different colors sometimes. \\nThe animals have a little bit of variety but in the end you're see the same hopping pineapple on a ton of planets as well. The animals also don't pose a single threat or have any interesting interactions to them at all. They feel like empty husks. Even if the animals are hostile to you they just run up to you and you get hit. But it's not really a threat.\\nEnvironmental damage like weather and such also poses no threat at all. Once again more of an empty husk.\\n\\nSo what we've established is that everything is essentially a shallow empty husk when it comes down to it.\\n\\n\\n[b]Lets talk about base building for a second![/b]\\nThe building in this game is not that great. There are instances where you'll think you should be able to place something down but it won't let you and that's just really frustrating. Like you can put railings in a certain spot next to stairs or you can't put stairs next to arches or you can't put a trading terminal on a wooden wall or the health and hazard modules you can put down don't work because it says you need power yet there is no way to hook them up to power.\\n\\nAlso when building in multiplayer the person who was at my base was not able to see the changes I was doing not to mention the lag you get when going to certain bases and I have a good rig to run games on.\\n\\n[b]I did try to build a couple bases and this is how it went:[/b]\\nI attempted to build a couple bases and my first base that I spent quite a while on was sunk into the ground when I came back one day totally ruining the build and I essentially had to delete it. Now I did not terraform anything to build this base so the bug (Is it a bug?) where the ground regrows in your base wasn't a thing here. It literally just moved underground and the top part was sticking out.\\n\\nThe second base I attempted to make also took me quite a while and I came back one day and it was tilted. It wasn't when I built it though. So that one got deleted. \\n\\nThe third base which I spent the most time on was amazing. But once again suddenly when I got back a terrain feature from that planet spawned in it and it wasn't there before. Not to mention the people I was playing with didn't even see it. It was only on my end. But that also ruined my base.\\n\\nAfter those 3 instances I honestly stopped trying... Imagine spending hours on a base just to have it ruined by bugs over and over again and you can't do anything about it.\\n\\n\\n[b]Lets talk about multiplayer now...[/b]\\nTrying to join someone in multiplayer is an actual nightmare... I would join someone and they wouldn't be able to see me. Ships that land at trading posts and space stations would have different stats for both of us. Sometimes ships would land in each other. \\nNexus group quests would be fun to do even though they're super easy and having a group for it isn't even needed at all but once you go back to try and turn it in you might get put in a different nexus instance essentially making it so you can't see each other anymore even if you go back to the same system and you'd have to go through the nightmare of rejoining again.\\n\\nLong story short is that my friends and I essentially had to play solo and just talk in discord for the most part instead of actually playing together because of the huge amount of bugs associated with it not to mention the lag when going to each others bases.\\n\\nOnce again Multiplayer is a empty husk of nothingness.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about ships, frigates and freighters?[/b]\\nShips and freighters is going to be your main time sink in this game. Finding a ship or freighter you like and then getting it in the highest class you can might take you 10 minutes or days. \\nMaking money for those ships might also take you quite a while unless you decide to use cheats, exploits or broken mechanics which a lot of people do. \\n\\nAs for frigates which are the small ships that come with freighters. You can send them on quests and get rewards for it. It's essentially a shallow mechanic. \\nNot to mention the fact that once frigates get damaged in a mission and they get back you might not be able to fix them so then you just have to delete them from your fleet so if you spent the time to find S class frigates you can say bye bye to your time spent and the money you spent hiring the frigate.\\n\\nWhat happened to me is that my frigates got back and I had to repair them. In order to do that you need to land on the frigate however the landing pads were broken meaning you couldn't land on them and therefor you couldn't repair them.\\n\\nYou also can't change colors on ships which lets be honest here should be a thing in a game like this specially after all this development time. Even a simple mechanic where you can re-roll a ships paint job through their random generation system for a fee at a space station or something would be good enough.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about mission? How about the story?[/b]\\nMissions are the same shallow missions over and over again that are super easy and honestly not worth doing. \\n\\nThe story is uninteresting and shallow. They just have you jumping all over the place to add game time and say it's content but in reality it's just padding in my opinion. In fact you might go through the entire story only to have your decision at the end bug out your entire game.\\n\\n\\n[b]How about flying and how about VR?[/b]\\nFlying around is pretty good once you get used to it and in VR it feels really nice to fly around. \\nI haven't had any motion sickness at all which is a very good thing. I have to give them credit for that one.\\nThe game however is very poorly optimized and not just for VR and still carries a lot of simple VR bugs with it at the writing of this review.\\n\\nThat being said the ship combat is once again not that great. it's the same thing over and over. Oh pirates want your stuff... Oh you won't give it to them? Lets have you spend some time killing these ships that don't pose a single threat what so ever and have nothing good for loot. They're just an annoyance.\\nI must say that ship combat in VR is a lot more interesting but in the end it boils down to the same thing.\\n\\n\\nThat's pretty much it.\\nThere are better games to spend your money on that aren't as shallow as this game is.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I had been interested in the game since release, but was kept away by early reports. With the new updates, improved multiplayer, and a lack of satisfying multiplayer exploration games, I bought No Man's Sky (along with my wife) after the Beyond update. Our initial efforts to play the game were plagued by problems. First and foremost among them, was a disassociation between what each of us was experiencing, despite being in game together. She would frequently get assaulted and killed by hostile animals, despite them being invisible and unaffectable to me. Similarly, I was overwhelmed by storms, while she saw clear skies. After a week of this sort of play, we threw our hands up in frustration. \\nIn an attempt to salvage the experience, I suggest we explore in Creative mode, and see what the game had to offer, and perhaps spend some time designing bases on worlds we liked the look of. Though this experience gave us a few more days of play, it was repetitive, unengaging, and generally a huge letdown.\\nI haven't explored this game in single player mode much, but after seeing the limits to what CAN be researched, designed, explored, and created, I have to say I can't imagine spending much more time in this game. The worlds, aliens, and missions are stunningly repetitive. Uncovering alien languages seems neat initially, but it is frustratingly slow (who learns new languages one word at a time?) and requires hearing the same alien dialogue over and over again.\\nI'm still hopeful that Hello Games will continue to upgrade and improve this game, but at this point in its iteration, it's decidedly underwhelming still. Even as a light exploration game, the act of navigating (the galaxy, the solar system, and the many worlds) is remarkably frustrating. This game still needs a ton of work.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The tutorial is a mess and you don't have time digesting the information the game is throwing at you. Once you manage to survive all of it, I figure it would be cool to make a base on a extreme cold planet since I did have a S class hazard protection module that allow me to be invincible in extreme cold. Wonder why it stop working after a while once I collect more of them, then learn it was a bug (that would trigger a annoying sonar sound) and were worthless, meaning all the time spending on the base was a waste. Why each upgrade have they own energy pool anyway? It just make thing more confusing and annoying to recharge in the quick menu.\\n\\nYou also have no way to buy the ship you want or to sell directly, meaning you have to sit idle in a space station or a trading post like a idiot and scan every ship one by one once they are landed (cause a space dealer is too much to ask apparently), finding a broken ship is not worth to repair, your better off repair it enough to make it flight capable and trading it for a fully fixed one, the grind for them is insane otherwise...Did I mention grind? this is all you will do for the whole game, to the point is hard to appreciate or have time exploring.  Finding a S class freighter also legitimately required dedication unless you cheese the free one, and even then is pure rng, it can take a few try to a few day and they is no reliable way to get one otherwise.\\n\\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg, the game is fill with bugs. I though ok maybe they are fixing it or just need time, but apparently, from what I read the dev made a few megatread for bug fixing and usually only fix like 10 of them on the whole list after a very long time, making them pointless and unlikely all the bug I am encountering will get fixed.\\n\\nI honestly feel all the hour I spend on the game was a waste of time to the point I regret buying this game.

Because you need luck to get it. No skill is required to get the best items. Only luck. The dices of randomness decide what ship, what weapon you get. You are not satisfied with less than perfect weapons and ships? Then this game is not for you. You need to spend a lot of time and many many retries to get what you want. Or you cheat. But if you cheat you can give yourself unlimited money and declare yourself the winner of the game, if you are that type of player.

       "  'review': 'At first glance it is a great game.  You get dropped into this mess of stuff with out any real good explanation.  There are helpful hints that take up 25% of the lower right corner of your screen.  But they do not really help you understand how the game functions.  Those helpful hints quickly become VERY annoying as they ruin the realism of the game and cannot be turned off.  I played this game on the PS4 about a year ago.  Coming back into it now, even with my previous experience, I find myself lost.  After a while though I got it all sorted out and was moving long nicely.  I start to REALLY enjoy the game.  But then I start hitting one bug after another.  Plains do fly right, plants once harvested can never be harvested again, strange strange display bugs.  They promised multiplayer but it does not work.  Spent hours just trying to see my friend.  Got it working once or twice but that was all.  After hours and hours of play I hit yet another of the endless bugs.  Suddenly I cannot edit the main part of my base.. The base only has about 15 items but it seems that is some sort of limit.  This is where I stopped.  I have had enough.  But the most frustrating bug of all is when you are in VR choosing the build menu.  Some careless  programmer switched the menus.  So when you see the menu and select an item in the tree it is on the right.  But after you enter the menu it is on the left... so.. you find yourself in the wrong menu EVERY TIME!  This is so frustrating.  How could that get past beta testing?  DO THEY EVEN TEST THIS GAME?  (:\\n\\nIt is very clear to me that  the programmers that made this were sitting in office chairs and not on a couch.  Try opening your ship when the leavers to do it are INSIDE YOUR COUCH under you, next to you.  And the controls the fly the ship are virtual and deep inside your crotch.  This causes you to have to bend your wrist in some pretty strange ways to get the ship to fly.\\n\\nAnyhow, after hours of play the game got very laggy.  Going into any area causes the game to hang up and give me lots of strange mind bending display errors.   If you use VR you know what that is like.  Between that and my base locking up I am more or less over this game.',\n",

But its pretty clear that everyone has some rose-tinted goggles on.\\n\\nThe game is significantly better from release but it's still so damn disappointing. \\n\\nMULTIPLAYER\\n-   Not really multiplayer at all, the coop elements arent integrated enough. Quests cant be shared, progress cant be shared etc.\\n-   A lot of things are client side and just simply dont appear for your coop partner. Weather storm coming? Just for you.\\n-   The hub is pretty boring.\\n\\nCONTROLS\\n-    The controls are awful, the UI and UX are poorly designed and show no intuition\\n\\nSTORY\\n-    The story was pretty intriguing at first but falls behind quick due to the obscene bugs blocking you from actually progressing through it.\\n\\nPROGRESSION\\n-    The progression in this game is terrible, going from starting gear to end game gear is pretty much one step. Not to mention the fact that you can get all the credits you'll ever need by visiting some randoms base that gives away end game minerals.\\n-    Also you can use save editors to spawn anything you want in.\\n\\nBASE BUILDING\\n-    This was actually pretty good, lots of things to choose from but ultimately the experience was ruined by the UI.\\n\\nOverall for the price 5/10!\\n\\nId pay 20 bucks at most for this.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m not one of those who was bitter over the game release, because I saw that debacle coming and stayed out of it. I didn\\'t buy the game until the Atlas Rises update, and I really enjoyed playing it for a while. It was a chill game with plenty to do. My only real problem with it was the base building limitations. Pieces would disappear and there are rendering problems, that persist to this day.\\n\\nAfter building some decent bases, buying a bunch of ships and designing a nice freighter, I put it on a shelf for a while until the \"Atlas Next\" update came out. In this update, they decided to redesign all of the stuff that was working fine and I spent a full weekend rebuilding and repairing everything I had (well actually more, when you count having to redo the freighter from scratch), and by the end of that, I was burned out on the game again. I didn\\'t really get to play much, I mostly just got back to where I was before and put it on the shelf again.\\n\\nThen I hear about the \"Beyond\" update and I get excited because it seems like they added VR. I heard it\\'s buggy and even borderline unplayable, but I still want to check out my ships and builds. Before attempting VR, I log in and my base is, of course, missing pieces again, but worse, they added a new onerous power requirement to everything and it looks like it will take a lot longer than a weekend to get back to where I was again. I then logged out for the last time. Even if I wanted to update my bases with hundreds of cables, they wouldn\\'t be able to handle it, performance wise. It\\'s probably worse than any other building game out there, in that respect.\\n\\nIf I would have thought of it, I would have snapshoted this game, before this latest update, so that I could still play on occasion again. It was fun for a while and I guess I got my money\\'s worth. But all of the game breaking updates make me not want to invest anymore time in NMS. I play a lot of Alpha games, and they\\'re all typically more stable and better optimized than this 3+ year old game. And by adding a lot of micromanagement to a game that typically hasn\\'t had it, it just doesn\\'t feel the same anymore. I play enough grindy games, I don\\'t need another.\\n\\nI kind of regret the time I put into it now, and therefore I can\\'t recommend it. And no way, is it ever worth the full price.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't recommend this game for more than $20. I bought it after the Beyond VR update, people say the big updates have fixed the game so I can't imagine what it was like at launch.\\n\\nOverall the game is addictive fun, but lacking in almost every area. The game tries to do a lot but doesn't do anything well.\\n\\nThe multiplayer aspects are barely there, it's basically playing single player alongside a friend. There's no sort of cheat protection either. Fps performance is poor.\\n\\nControls and menus are bad, especially ship controls. Inventory management is difficult and inventories are too small. Dialogue is unskippable most of the time and fairly slow/boring. The open world aspects are good (transitions from planet to space etc.), but the joy of exploration drops off quickly and new areas become repetitive. Base building is fun but not useful. Survival is not challenging unless you play hardcore, which makes the game more grindy.\\n\\nGear progression in the game is paced badly. And once you have enough capital/inventory space to farm cash it invalidates a lot of other game mechanics.The quest chain is pretty interesting but apart from the story and grinding for gear there's no endgame.\\n\\nAfter ~20 hrs you've seen most of the game. Unless you're a completionist I don't think the game is worth $40 let alone $80. Buy Subnautica instead.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve sat on this game for 3 years waiting for the day that it would live up to its original promises. I got cheated out of my money, and today, I got cheated out of my progress.\\n\\nI decided to come back and try out the newest patch (don\\'t ask me, I don\\'t know the name or care, all I know was there was multiplayer finally). Played for about 2 days, started to enjoy some of the new planets, and then my freighter reset itself. \\n\\nAll the building I had put into it from even before this latest patch, gone. I had so much shit. Hours of progress that I had accumulated over the course of 3 years, checking in here and there to see what new things this game could offer me. It\\'s just gone. \\n\\nThere are several frigates around my ship that I can\\'t even do anything with now because the room you use to debrief them is gone, lol. What a disappointment. \\n\\nMaybe it\\'s a new difficulty factor they\\'ve added to the game? At any moment you can have your entire base/inventory wiped clean! Oh joy what fun!\\n\\n3 years running, and this game is still a buggy mess. Moments before even this incident I had a freighter request my help that was INSIDE A PLANET. I\\'m done. This game is beyond redemption. We\\'ll be in next gen territory when this game is finally \"finished\" and there are already better space based exploration games out there. \\n\\nDon\\'t waste your money, but most importantly don\\'t waste your TIME.',\n",

There are about 5 variations of ships which are hardly distinguishable besides by look. The game is vast and empty. Visiting new planets and systems is more of a chore than a progression. The whole game is more of a chore than a game. Lots of bugs. AI may as well be non existent. Dialogue is petrifying. Your quest changes whenever you pick something up that has a tutorial attached, This happens so often in the beginning of the game that you end up hours in and still not aware that you havent been doing the main quest. The main quest...... I can hardly remember it. If its a space game youre after I would recommend Avorion or Pulsar, both of which are light years ahead of this STEAMing mess.',\n",

       "  'review': '\"Game last saved X seconds ago\" is a lie.\\n\\nThe worst part is with their mixed save method (world changes affect everyone) the resources you gathered are not there to be collected any more, but the results of gathering are lost.\\n\\nI dusted this off to try out in VR.  VR is the normal hot mess of really good potential with lots of quirks and problems.  Some of the controls in VR finally feel like a game made for VR rather than a PC to VR port, but others result in a huge loss of fine motor control that just make it frustrating.  Some examples are trying to focus on objects you want to interact with (open boxes, pick up cubes, etc).  Trying to mark items in the visor in VR is also problemmatic since you kind of have to look at the item out of the corner of your eye for the mark option to even be available..',\n",

       "  'review': 'I decided to give this game a try after so many updates and found it horrible. Extremely shallow game with no content that tries to slow you down as much as possible to deceive you that it is long. I\\'ve asked for  a refund 3 times and was denied because by the time that I\\'ve realized how bad the game was the 2 hours had already passed. I recommend it to anyone who wants to play pretend, not to anyone who wants a game with real progression. For this there is Terraria, Astroneer, Subnautica and Satisfactory.\\n\\nHere are some of the negatives. You could write a book with so many design problems and bugs that the game has, but the review would be too long:\\n\\n- Excessive grinding involved in everything you do, including forcing you to talk to virtually ALL NPCs and hear the same idiotic phrase to learn ONE word of their language, otherwise you don\\'t understand anything they say;\\n\\n- Even when selecting menu options has griding. Each time you select something, you have to hold the button for + or - 1 second to confirm. Over time it becomes increasingly annoying;\\n\\n- If you think the ships and upgrades you pick up later will make the gameplay more varied, forget it. They only boosts the skills that your character and vehicles already know how to do. Congratulations on buying a expensive upgrade to sprint 10% longer!;\\n\\n- All this game does is to slow you down and make duration of it artificially much longer than it should, with quests \"go from point A and collect / build / kill x and come back\";\\n\\n-Spaceflight is also a totally limited and repetitive crap, with more asteroids than open space. Every time an enemy comes to interrupt the already boring flight from one planet to another. It has no interesting star body;\\n\\n- Inventory management (which is tiny by the way) has to grind up space stations to expand it, with chests that fit 5 f * cking item stacks that require power to function. By doing so, they force you to trash of loot to force you to collect it again later, going back to what I\\'ve said regarding to \"slow you down\".\\n\\nPositive:\\n\\n- Graphics. Wonderful. But still, I expected a real game, not a photo simulator.\\n\\nBuy at your own risk.',\n",

       "  'review': \"The Beyond update was intended to improve the game.  For long-time players it seems to have offered enough to revitalize their game.  They have, however, lived with so many of the game's issues that remain broken and their used to them and so they're happy with the fixes.  But for new players old problems are not welcome and patches and fixes have created yet more problems.  This, coupled with some odd design choices, make the game problematic as a whole, especially for $60.\\n\\nOnce you acquire a freighter, it's possible to fall through the superstructure and die in space, or get trapped outside the playable space meaning you have to reload or die.\\n\\nThere are lots of technologies available but tutorials/information on them are minimal.  The game does have, sort of, a guided quest system that helps, somewhat.\\n\\nYou can't truly upgrade your existing ship, i.e., add tech slots and those that exist are not positioned to make what improvements you can make playable.  \\n\\nThe only way to 'upgrade' your ship is to buy a new one or find a broken one.  The problem here is, if you have been able to add tech upgrades to your ship, many of these are not transferable, which means you lose your investment and need to purchase things all over again.\\n\\nIt's a space game with trading stations all over.  Yet, you can't buy a ship there.  You can buy ship improvements but there's no dry dock so you can't reconfigure the ship you have.\\n\\nInformation/tutorials on game play are a frost.  You can seek some help on YouTube, but the problem here is few of these are helpful, mostly just older players showing off--see me and how good I am, not tutorials.  Further most of those available are so far out of date as to be counter productive.\\n\\nDon't know what it is about some game developers having it in for saving games.  The process here is truly annoying and cumbersome, especially give the glitch noted earlier about falling through the infrastructure and getting trapped.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Too buggy. Too inconsistent. Way too many things that you'd expect the game to easily have, like:\\n- Colorblind mode. The game expects you to differentiate between differently tiered star systems by colors alone. A nice big middle finger to the colorblind. Thanks Hello Games!\\n- A competent building system. What's that? You just placed removed a floor and can't add it back again? Either reload your save from 20 minutes ago, or enjoy the next 20 minutes replacing every single thing, and possibly losing materials because of their ridiculously buggy inventory system. Never mind the countless of times where you can't put something where you want it, despite there being no good reason whatsoever as to why you can't.\\n- Not having your ship spawn inside existing things. You just made your base next to something pre-existing, to continue a nice symbiotic relationship. But lo and behold, the game decides to just plant your ship inside their building when you get back to your base.\\n- An amazing storyline where you learn to use portals to go anywhere in the universe. ...only to be locked into that system, making portals entirely useless. I understand the devs don't want people rushing towards the end, but why not? Let people play how they want to play.\\n- An innovative way to learn 3 different languages. By taking 30 seconds every time you want to learn a new word because you have to click 3 buttons and go through 5 different slow text boxes to get there, and there being no good other way to learn these languages. There's like 10K words for each language.\\n- A fun way to edit terrain. You can simply paint spheres onto terrain or dig spheres into terrain, middle finger to anyone who likes to make tidy bases, amirite?\\n- GUI to be intuitive and easy to use. Because nobody likes going through 5 different menus and long lists to earn a specific currency in the game, while in a previous version you had a singular button that would do all of that for you. Nobody likes being used to one inventory system, and then have some type of outdated buggy inventory system that refuses to let you take out anything.\\n- Expandable inventory systems. Sure, you can upgrade your own inventory over time, and I'm sure if it's completely upgraded, it'll be super useful. But I do not fathom why you wouldn't be able to create large inventory systems in the bases that you can create. Why not drop off large amounts of valuables and store them deep underground? Why force the player to be continuously in the stress of what they have to throw away next to get that one item they now need as well?\\n- Some remote type of way to get the player what they want without being 3000% dependable on RNG. It's absolutely mental how the only way to become more versatile and stronger in this game is entirely up to RNG. There's no technical progression, there's just grinding and random luck to get what you want. It's Beyond frustrating.\\n\\nI was one of the idiots who pre-purchased this because everything looked amazing, but ended up refunding it. Only to buy it years later on a discount when people can't shut up about how much it has improved.\\n\\nIt hasn't. It's still awful. It has a ton of new content, if you can drag your sore butt through all of the bugs and grinding this game forces you to do. What a complete waste of what could otherwise be an absolutely amazing game.\\n\\nDo not recommend, just because of the sheer frustration, anger, sorrow and hate this game has caused me.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I bought No Man\\'s Sky right before the BEYOND update when it was 50 percent off. I feel that was a fair price for what I got. Obviously I\\'ve sunk some time into the game, so while I cannot really say the game is bad, I also cannot say I\\'d recommend it to anyone at full price. And I\\'m not sure I\\'d recommend it even then until there are more updates.\\n\\nThe problem with NMS -- the thing that ultimately made me say, \"Eh, time to try something else\" -- is that the \"world\" feels so small and unvaried. \\n\\nYou are ostensibly an explorer in an endless galaxy, able to visit infinite worlds, and yet every world you visit feels like a differently-colored version of the same world, inhabited by the same sentient alien races, with the same set-pieces and the same rewards. After you\\'ve been to a dozen or so star systems, all sense of wonder is gone because every star system has one of three versions of the same space station, is controlled by one of the same three races, and consists of somewhere between one and a dozen worlds that look essentially like every other world you\\'ve previously visited.\\n\\nPut another way: NMS is premised on exploration but for all intents and purposes you\\'re done with the exploration about 20 - 30 hours into the game because by that point you\\'ve met every NPC alien race, seen every architectural set piece, harvested the same resources on the same five or six types of planets, seen the same two or three types of freighter ships, etc. Some examples of what I\\'m talking about:\\n\\n* There are a couple varieties of freighter ships, including some admittedly beautiful rare ones. But the interior of every freighter is exactly the same, so it kind of doesn\\'t matter. Same thing with space stations: every star system has one, but every station is, on the inside, exactly the same.\\n\\n* There are buildings and ruins scattered on every planet, but all the buildings, etc., use the same handful of models, but with different colors. So irrespective of how strange the world itself looks (and very, very few of them look genuinely strange or \"alien\"), the \"places\" you visit on each planet are the same.\\n\\n* There are three sentient races and they apparently populate every star system throughout the galaxy. You\\'ll never meet a previously undiscovered NPC race, or make contact with an obscure alien empire -- you\\'re only ever going to meet one of three alien types. \\n\\nNMS is, to me, a poor man\\'s Subnautica. The contrast between the two games really highlights how you can achieve a better sense of wonder and fear and discovery with a carefully-curated setting where there\\'s real, artistic variety between biomes and among creatures -- where exploration allows you to explore further, deeper, into more dangerous places that feel different than any place you\\'ve ever been before -- than in a game that simply takes place in an \"infinite\" galaxy where everything is basically a dozen shades of the same thing.\\n\\nNMS has the bones of a truly ground-breaking and amazing experience. But it\\'s not worth $60 USD. Perhaps in an update or two, with more variety or a better story (don\\'t even get me started on how sloppy and predictable that was), it will be that game.',\n",

After dying, I was stuck. Hungry aliens still surround me, angry sentinels still preventing me from recharging my gear, and the planet itself trying to kill me so I can't run away to mine somewhere else. Yeah, not going to give this a recommendation, since I don't feel like dealing with this any more. It might be fun for other people, I might even be able to enjoy it myself if I got further, but I'm not going to put up with the annoying parts to get to any potential good parts.\\n\\nFinal Verdict: Start wasn't fun enough to get me to keep playing until it 'got better.'

On a full playthrough I counted thirteen 'Lilly-crabs' on different planets and seven 'Shroom-rats' How is this possible. But it gets better, each and every toxic planet is littered with mushroom trees that lack any unique features other then the games attempt to give them names. God forbid you read the writing of this game, it'll leave a seventh graders writing project look like a master piece, honestly the NPC coding may have been done by a seventh grader, they're all copys of each other, I swear where they sit may even be pre-set. Each race has maybe three-six lines worth of speech  rendering any translation or grinding pointless, once you've heard one Vy call you weak you've heard them all. I won't even bother talking about the constant bugs, poorly designed systems or the lack of combats relevance, the games a steaming pile and may as well just be wiped, it feels like the early early demo, no combat, NPCs are pointless, planets are barren, everything looks the same.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'You have to admire Hello Games and Sean Murray for not cutting and running after the disastrous (though thoroughly deserved) negative reception No Mans Sky received on its original release. Instead, like tenacious bulldogs, they stuck with their game, and several major updates later, here we are with \"Beyond\"....the biggest update yet. Good for them!\\n\\nSadly the main problem with NMS remains....the game is, at its heart, a boring and tedious grind of resource gathering. A grind, it should be noted, that is simply performed so that the player can get a little better at grinding.\\n\\nHad HG spent their time and resources making the core game play loop more fun and interesting, they\\'d surely have a stunning game to offer. As it is, despite all these new features they have added, the game remains merely a superior tech demo, still gagging for a game to be added.\\n\\nThe game\\'s strongest suit is \"Exploration\"....see the entire galaxy for yourself, one planet at a time. The problem is there is little here WORTH exploring in the first place. The galaxy may be massive, but it is also very, very dull. That leaves us with lack-luster space flight, lack-luster combat, lack-luster multiplayer interaction and lack-luster base-building. Not much to go on for a recommendation is it?',\n",

I honestly don’t know how I have as many hours as I do but still have a feeling that I’ve accomplished absolutely nothing in this game. \\n\\nThere is a general feeling of buggyness in this game that doesn’t go away. If you join a friend’s game it breaks your quests in a way I can’t understand. I was hiding in a cave waiting for a storm to pass and just glitched through the floor and died with a full inventory. On a permadeath character I was picking oxygen plants and just died. No idea what killed me but there went at least 10 hours of gameplay. The game just isn’t worth it.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'I wanted to try this game since I kept hearing it was THE game that actually turned it around, that they had taken their product that was one of the most infamous flops in video game history and made it into a great game with a dedicated following.  Well I tried it, I gave it my all and powered through the pain to give it a fair chance, and I just don\\'t get it.  And I don\\'t mean I don\\'t get it as in the zero story zero direction and no compelling aspects of multiplayer leave the gameplay so incomprehensibly unsatisfying that I can\\'t imagine playing it... I mean I don\\'t get it as in this is one of the buggiest games I have ever played-- and I played PUBG on release.  I found myself running into bugs, that required a work around to continue playing, in almost every aspect of the game.  Every time the work around was at minimum closing the entire game.  These bugs aren\\'t uncommon or only in niche circumstances, in fact most of them come up through natural gameplay and cause you to take drastic actions before you can continue playing.  What\\'s even worse is when I search all these bugs they\\'re all present in forum posts 2-3 years ago, and yet they still plague the game.  Additionally, nothing in this game is told do you.  It feels like one of those games where all the information we have had to be datamined and is only playable with a wiki being 60% of the gameplay.  Searching how almost any mechanic works gets you articles titled \"X things No Man\\'s Sky didn\\'t tell you.\"\\nTL:DR\\n-   Gameplay loop is strictly grinding for the sake of grinding with no payoff\\n-   The mostly consistently buggy game I\\'ve ever played\\n-   Everything is cryptic in an uninteresting and unrewarding way\\n-   1/10  it\\'s not impossible to enjoy the game if you like the grind but the game holds no punches trying to stop you',\n",

No idea because I am so concerned about not dying to sunstroke that I feel I don\\'t have enough time to read all the information popping up on the screen. I can either sit in the heat and read WTF is happening or just run around and try and find a shady spot to not die. \\n\\nI start a new game in the easiest difficulty and now I am dying from radiation. This game has a terrible tutorial system. I have no idea what my buttons/controls are and already dying from something.\\n\\nTake a page from Subnautica\\'s book and learn how to slowly introduce a new idea/mechanic. In that game I had no idea on what to do, however with very basic idea and a system that doesn\\'t kill you as you read/understand the basic principles of the games, it makes sense. I\\'m underwater, swim to the surface to get air. Easy.\\n\\nBut with No Man Sky I am immediately filled with death because I have no idea what I need to do to not burn to death. \\n\\nIf anything don\\'t just put people randomly in space with nothing. Introduce the idea of \"whatever you are trying to get them to learn\" in doses. \\n\\nEX: Player states in a airlock/base that is *VERY SLOWLY* getting hotter. An announcer states that the player must user X item to cool it down. X item can be found in the supply room. Uh oh, supply room only enough to support the base and your suit for 24 hours. You now need to find X item out on the new planet you discovered and have established a base on. \\n\\nThe idea of putting someone in a \"dangerous situation\" and teaching them about to use all the buttons and controls makes a huge difference. The best example I can give is Subnautica. \\n\\n\"OMG we crash landed on an alien planet, and you need to do XYZ\". \\n\\nI didn\\'t instantly get attacked by the environment. I did need to worry about food and water. But I wasn\\'t instantly dying from the start.\\n\\nI heard so many good things and bad things about No Man Sky, and honestly if you want to play an exploration game with survival quality. Pick up any of the following:\\n\\nSubnautica\\nMinecraft\\nDon\\'t Starve\\n\\nThey mostly have no tutorial but the basic idea of what I need to do to not instantly die is present. I know I need to find food, water and shelter. With No Man Sky I just feel lost and like I am not having fun. All of the other games listed I almost immediately enjoyed an wanted to play more.

The game that was expected to be so great and different but ironically was terrible and repetitive. A shame, for sure. \\n\\nNow, more than 3 years later it has been actively updated and 'improved'. But if you were to ask me I would say that's a load of bollocks. From playing this for less than 2 hours I can say, with full confidence.... don't buy this bloody game. It takes on a repetitive feel and many things about the game feel lifeless and empty, I bet a dead person would be more alive that this shit. The game was fun for possibly half an hour or so but after the first planet I realised that you have to do the same thing every time but with slightly different scenery. Revolutionary.\\n\\nTo be fair, the game looks beautiful. It's colourful and sometimes satisfying to explore a little. But then you realise your life support is failing and you're about to die.\\n\\nI tried to give this game a chance as I have watched it grow slowly while keeping up with update news. I decided I would give it a go when it was 50% off. Still not worth the money unfortunately.\",\n",

Sometimes, even if a planet says it has copper, you can walk around for hours and not find a single deposit.\\n\\nThe quest line is tedious. You're constantly travelling between planets. Not only do you spend an obscene amount of time just waiting for your spaceship to arrive in the right planet, you only spend a second or two talking to an npc or building a machine. I could not get past the boredom of watching my spaceship travel between planets and galaxies.\\n\\nAfter the novelty wears off, the game is not as exciting as I hoped it to be. But underneath the tedious quests and resource gathering, I believe there is a good game. But as it is now, it is still not worth its 60 dollar price tag.\",\n",

Anyway, things were fine until the NMS Beyond update DLC, and now the game is unplayable.  I have an AMD Radeon R7 and R9.  I have uninstalled it and am wiping my hands of it.  The reason is simple: It is unplayable and it is impossible to show you why.  I took screenshots and they look fine, as they should, but the game itself becomes a Tye-Dye mess upon launch.  To that end, for the moment, I am done.  I was enjoying the open exploration and various gameplay, but this is too much to deal with, as I have other titles that don't frustrate me and run just fine.  The creators have released several updates since Beyond dropped, but none have mattered to my problem.  So, I'm out for now on this one. I can't recommend this title as a result.\",\n",

Do not listen to anyone that says otherwise.\\nLeaving a space station and attempting to warp to a planet somehow got me stuck inside of the station, which caused me to take damage with no way to escape, so I died and lost everything in my ship and person. Then, when I respawned on some planet I've never been to, I started high up and fell to my death, again. Somehow respawning must have overwritten my save, so there was no way to get all the items I had and needed back, as my last save in the manual slot was over ten hours of of playtime less as I was warping around planets towards the galactic core. I don't see how they could even consider adding a permadeath mode in this game while it is in this state. This is a massive setback and I doubt I will ever be able to play this game again.\\nTo add to this, the game has awful performance, and extremely obvious pop in, which can sometimes cause you to crash into things. Many things still have awful extremely low quality textures even though I stand right in front of them.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'That Hello Games is still trying to provide the game they lied about releasing 3 years ago is commendable, unfortunately it still is deeply flawed. Even after the latest update the game remains an amalgamation of botched, half-assed, broken.\\n\\nYes, the game has its moments: Discovering new planets, especially some of the pre-made anomalous ones, can be enjoyable and while the gameplay is shallow, it is so in a pleasant way. However:\\n\\nThe UI is a Frankenstein\\'s monster of botched console port and poor design decisions. During development and in the 3 years since release, no apparent effort has been made to adapt the UI to PC. Every button, every menu and every screen handles akwardly and screams \"made for console\". The current patch introduced the biggest advancement in this area since 3 years ago: The duration for which you have to hold your mouse button to make a click has been reduced from ~2s to almost instant in various menus.\\nOnce you have finally reached your desired menu, the functions are lacking and information is poorly visualized whereever not absent. Even the most basic features like the solar system and galaxy maps are barely functional and would be an embarrasment even for an Indy-game in Alpha made by 2 people.\\n\\nEven after more than a dozen patches in roughly a week, the game remains buggy and has been so for years. While the effort to provide patches quickly is commendable, the fact that the new update was released in such a state gives you an idea of value HG places on quality-assurance and -control, and a sinister forshadowing of the amount of bugs amd issues you will encounter while playing.\\nContinuing the reoccuring theme of \"botched, half-assed and broken\", even content that is years old still is troubled by basic and glaring issues. To give an example: If you google the problem that terrain is regenerating back into bases and buildings you built, you will find threads from over a year ago. HG said that they were looking into it, the issue remains unsolved to this day.\\n\\nIn general many features feel unfinished and rushed, even reworks used to promote the \"new big update\" are made half-assed: While the player inventory was increased to be able to hold dozens of large stacks of items, HG did not update a single one of the various other inventories(ships, freighters, storage containers, ...), leaving them grotesquely out of line. Botched, half-assed, broken.\\n\\nThe asking price of 55€ is obscene, and even the current discount of -50% does not feel like a great deal for what you get.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I returned to No Man's Sky Beyond after the initial No Man's Sky PS4 release in 2016. I left at some point because it reached a plateau where things felt stagnant and became more of the same grinding. Now in 2019, with a Valve Index and powerful PC, and, of course, all of the exciting developer updates in Beyond, I was super excited for the VR space adventure. Alas, the bubble has burst after my last few game experiences. Crashing after exploring a good hour on a planet (losing all progress), aliens buried in the floor when talking to them, and ultimately no longer loading in (crashing after a 10 minute load time wait, when nothing has changed since my last game). All these took me out of the immersive VR experience that could have been. It feels like this game has gotten too top heavy for its good. I appreciate the patch after patch release, but it ultimately made my game experience so unstable, I've completely aborted the No Man's Sky mission once again. It's too bad, because it has so much potential to be the best VR game experience. But when you lose precious time to game breaking technical issues, it's just not worth your investment. Try, if you must. But it won't do. I really wanted to like this game, but it's a broken black hole. Not recommended.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Ok here is my honest review of NSM. Iv’e been playing for around a week and I can say NMS is a fun enjoyable game in concept. \\nThere is plenty to do, enough to keep you going & without being tedious or too time-consuming. Following the mission's path is fun when it works and the game won't put huge roadblocks in your way to progression, at least early on. \\nTo start with it was very enjoyable and I was looking forward to progressing into all that NMS has to offer.\\nHowever, there is one big fat massive elephant in the room & that's the fact that almost every system in the game is either poorly designed or even worse is riddled with game-breaking bugs.\\nNMS, a game that’s been in full release since 2016! It is so broken that actual Early access/Pre-release games put it to shame. \\nJust a few examples of game-breaking bugs I have encountered that are so fundamental to the core of the game. 1. Logging off in the Anomaly (the multiplayer hub) can spawn you outside of the Invisible barrier of the playable space when you reload the game, with no way to escape. I had to use a 3rd party save file editor to change the position of my character to save my entire save game. 2. Bounty Encounters do not reward the currency for completing them. 3. The inventory expansion vendor does not charge you giving you free upgrades. 4. Some building blocks don't work i.e the Medical unit pivotal in healing your character without endlessly hunting crates on planets 5. Electrical hookup points just stop showing after aiming a wire at them causing you to reload the game every time you want to make an electrical connection. 6. Many “treasures” appear under the mesh of the planet below the excavatable material. 7. Items get stuck in storage telling you that your inventory is full even though it's empty. 8. Some blueprint pictures don't match their items/descriptions making it very frustrating to find what you thought you purchased. 9. Putting quick menu functions on the “Hotbar”(1-9) will all default to summon ship after a jump or teleportation. Ok, more than a few but I could sit here typing all day with issues I've had. I've been taking screenshots and OBS recordings, submitting bugs more than you would In any Early access game.\\nMoving on to poor game design first on the list is it's clear that NMS was developed for console and PC was an afterthought or a non-thought and clearly goes Consol>VR>>>>>>>>PC Basic functions like Keybinding are tedious as binding requires you to do though many “Quick Menus” (Which is broken anyway) and you cannot bind anything to the scroll wheel. Which would be useful for changing multitool functions but instead you have to mash G. You cant bind them individually to number keys either and ofc you cant use a hotas with NMS. \\nThe game gives you 4-5 different building sets that don't play well together mixing and matching is a mistake you will regret when things won't place at all or line up Furthermore Tech items cant be placed on some building types and others just won't place at all. Want a Large refiner on basic building sure go ahead. Try to place a medium nope you need to put it in the Large building prefab… Want to place storage inside. Good luck you have to place it outside on the terrain unless you Cheat it by placing a foundation strut on a Normal foundation then delete it after leaving the storage floating less have unsightly poles sticking down under your base. All this meanwhile your building from layers upon layers of clunky cumbersome scroll menus. Overall navigating the menus and systems of NMS is confusing and unintuitive, having to question basic functions on the game's discord regularly.  Then discovering that long-time players didn't even know you could do what you're asking like binding quick menu items to 1-9. So that changing from 1st -3rd person can be 1 button press and not a 4 “quick menu”  navigation task. \\nSo would I recommend NMS the answer is no! The concept is good. The execution is terrible. The coders must suffer from hand Tourette's with the number of bugs and broken features and the QA team must be huffing glue to let so many things slide by. \\nThe only good thing about NMS is its great discord community  \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"No Man's Sky is a brilliant concept of a game. It has so much potential for long addicting sessions of play. Yeah I'm only 30 hours in... but that's part of my point. I played for 3 ten hour sessions easily with how addicting the game felt. But the issues I ran into have really put a brick wall in my path.\\n\\nThere are major game breaking issues which you may run into if you decide to buy the game.\\n\\nThese issues will cause you to lose hours and hours of progress, which will surely demoralize your will to play.\\n\\nIt's not a great feeling to just suddenly clip through the floor because of a cutscene, and be insta-killed. And at that moment you're left to gather your 'grave' to retrieve your entire inventory... but your grave is in an out of bounds location.\\n\\nNot to mention other small bugs that litter the game.\\n\\nI'm not one to play 'hardcore' type game modes. But the game forces you into a pseudo-hardcore russian roulette state. You may not get hit with these bugs... but they are out there, and can happen to anyone.\\n\\nI hate leaving a poor review... the idea of this game is so good. However, the devs need to focus on polishing the concept, rather than continuing to add on more and more small mechanical and gameplay content.\\n\\nHG, fix the issues before you decide to develop more content, PLEASE.\\n\\nI've touched a tiny sliver of the game, and no longer want to play. This is not a good sell.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I had given NMS a thumbs up because it is a good game with some great parts but the longer I have played the more the glitches have crept in.\\nWhile I applaud Hello Games for bringing NMS a long way from its beginning I do believe the issue is that they have tried so hard to add content, which is what the players demand, that they have overlooked a number of minor problems that are indicative of bigger issues.\\nFor example, when you are in a some of the menus and you look in the lower right hand corner you see the command to press escape to leave the menu, so you press escape and nothing happens, so you right click because that works on other menus and you leave the screen.\\nNow some may say \"What the fuck dude, just press the fucking right mouse key and play this big beautiful game.\"\\nBut this shows an inconsistency in how you use menus that is just sloppy and should be an easy fix.\\nIn video games consistency is very important, not because players are to stupid to figure stuff out but when you have menu interaction behaving differently from one screen to the next, escape working on some screens right click on others, it slowly erodes confidence.\\nWhile this is one small example it is one of many small QOL issues that add up.\\nBut this is not why I changed my review, it was just a foundation brick.\\nThe final problem was when looking for large copper deposit to mine I trekked over to one I had marked with my scanner only to find nothing there. I thought maybe it had spawned under ground so I gouged out a bloody big hole looking for the thing to no avail. I dug until all the little boxes were gone from pressing c but nothing but silica. The indicator was still there but then again, and this gets on my nerves, even when you deplete a deposit the indicator is still there so when you get turned around on a barren world you trek back to a hole in the ground that, according to the scanner should be full of something.\\nAgain small issue that adds up.\\nThen the indicator of what element made up trees and rocks stopped working and I wrote this review.\\nStop adding content. We believe you when you say you aren\\'t Satan in human form, you can make a good game Hello Games.\\nFix your games core mechanics, we will wait, you wowed us, people won\\'t stop playing if you don\\'t keep coming out with new stuff but they will when they are buried by glitches and bugs.\\n',\n",

The game is working even worse than it did before, so badly that I played for less than 5 minutes before I had to quit. I want to play the game. It\\'s fun when it doesn\\'t give me a headache because of how poorly it works. I\\'ll try again in a year.\\n\\nThis is a mix of a good and bad review. I would say yes I recommend the game, but not if you are having the issues I am having. The Beyond update brought a lot a good changes to the game, however my experience has been less than ideal. Before the update I would get a small stutter every now and then and while it was annoying, it was a very minor annoyance. Now I\\'m lucky to have a stable 20 FPS, and it usually just stutters enough to be extremely annoying but not enough to make me delete the game. I keep playing a bit every day to see if the problem has been fixed but nothing has changed.\\n\\nThere is also an issue with using an Xbox One controller, it will not let me use \"X\" to tag items or places, and sometimes it disconnects from the game completely. I would say the disconnect might be interference but it only disconnects on NMS. I\\'ve played 2 or 3 other games with absolutely zero issues.\\n\\nBasically, I love the game and it\\'s very fun. I want to play much more than I\\'m able. I might just have to put it on the back burner for a month or 3 until some performance issues get fixed.',\n",

       "  'review': \"No Man's Sky is by far the buggiest game I have ever played, so far in my playthrough, I have fallen through the map literally countless times. My game has crashed probably 20+ times and there is always a visual bug present. These bugs are completely unacceptable for a $60 3-year-old triple A-game. Not only are there bugs but the game is so poorly optimized that running the game on any decent settings can cause even beefy systems to take huge fps drops. The game certainly has fun aspects to it, the economic system is pretty enjoyable, the missions are for the most part good, and the upgrade system is nice. The only part of the whole experience that is done exceptionally well is the sheer scale of things. The amount of room you have to do what you want is amazing. Planets feel huge and considering solar systems can have 6+ planets per system that means you have just insane amounts of room. The issue lies in what is done with this room, while yes there is nearly infinite space to build on, there just simply isn't a lot to build. The base building mechanics are very simple and for a lot of people won't even change how they play the game. Having a base is not remotely essential, you gain nothing but shelter and access to missions by building a base. The best or at least the most profitable aspect of base building is farms you can make with mineral extractors that bring in millions of dollars entirely passively. These are decently easy to make and only require some buried tech and a few million dollars to buy materials (if you can't get them on your own.) This completely changes the balance of the game, suddenly that $40 million ship is no longer an insane investment that will bankrupt you but it's just a few hours of waiting. Trying to get a lot of money without a farm is pretty hard but arguably more enjoyable. Doing this will consist of you looking for ancient bones or salvageable tech. This means you have to find planets that have either one of these and then actually explore said planet. This makes money feel genuinely valuable and like a reward rather than something you just have. Back on the topic of base building, say you wanted to make a base and live in it what would that take? Well for starters your gonna need constant power, this would be fine if the power system was even remotely balanced. At first, you will probably make a bio-fuel generator, this will power a base for a very short time at the cost of a whole lot of carbon or oxygen, this is absolutely insane considering that solar panels are just a bit more expensive and will power your base for free. After you have your base powered with a few batteries and solar panels you will likely upgrade that to an electromagnetic generator. This is by far the easiest and most abundant source of power in the entire game. A single electromagnetic generator will power huge bases for just the cost of building it (which is incredibly low.) This is not balanced at all, you can literally power everything you can possibly want for super cheap and entirely passively. Even ignoring the power imbalance the actual wiring mechanics are horrid. This is a game where you talk to otherworldly lifeforms, can warp hyperspace, and literally teleport, and yet for some reason, there is no wireless power. What in the hell was Hello Games thinking? the wiring system is the least intuitive thing out of the entire game. Wires are always visible and will go through walls, they are huge as hell and make weird jagged angles, you can't connect wires from one base to another, etc. Trying to power something like a door is so confusing, for starters when a door is powered it is closed, why the hell is is that? There are no buttons automatically on a door so you have to go out and research them, after you have researched a button you place it on the door, power the door, and nothing happens. Buttons don't actually work on doors because for some reason power flows through the button into the door and is never shut off. Now you have to go back and research a lever or power inverter and try that. Finally, you get back, set everything up and now you can enter your base. At this point you realize that all you have build is a single door. \\n\\n\\n     The combat in this game is split into 2 parts, ground based player combat, and space combat. The player combat consists of fighting small drones called sentinels which come in waves that lead up to a huge walker robot that has 5 protective plates before you can hurt its actual health. This combat is not at all entertaining and feels more like a chore than it does a game mechanic. Not only is it boring but it doesn't reward you in the slightest. Often time fighting sentinels will be forced upon you since they will attack you if you mine anything near them, shoot any animals near them, or sometimes just are near them. If the player had any way of taking them out rapidly this wouldn't be as bad, however, all the weapon options are absolutely terrible. None of the weapons do any decent damage and all frequently require charging or reloading, this means most of your fighting will be done with the mining laser which is the most consistent weapon in the game but it is also slow and boring to use. On the topic of space fights the verdict is almost the same. Once more fights are forced upon you by hostile sub-space scans. These scans will appear at random while you are in space and can be avoided if you give the hostiles a typically large amount of money. Refusing to give them money will cause 1-5 hostile ships to warp in front of you, prevent you from warping and force you to slowly turn you ship to chip away their incredibly tiny, far away ship. There should be either no space combat or an entirely reworked system of space combat. All of these problems are just amplified in the new VR addition which is somehow more buggy than the base game. Give this game another 3 years in the oven and maybe it will be worth the full price.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Reviewers that I trust have been saying that this game has become a lot better since its original release, even good, so I thought it would be a good idea to try it out.\\n\\nWhen starting I'm already not very impressed with the UI. Buttons and other widgets move around trying to follow the cursor in a distracting manner. I have to long-click most things in order to activate them. I switched from keyboard/mouse to an XBox Elite controller which makes the interface quirks a bit more tolerable in my opinion.\\n\\nI spawn on a planet that has some sort of hazard, and I need sodium to prevent my spacesuit from melting. Off I go to harvest some sodium from glowing yellow plants. I have to manually recharge the spacesuit with the sodium I gathered, which is unnecessarily awkward to do, then head to my spaceship, which won't take off because it is damaged. I must follow instructions on screen in order to get materials and craft what I need to repair it. The whole thing is quite confusing but gets me flying.\\n\\nI take off and try to hover, but the ship will not stay put. It will always inch forward. It's not that it needs lift from moving forward as it's going too slowly for that. It just refuses to lower itself to the level of a helicopter. In most simulators the yoke works as in a real airplane, which means that if I pull on it it the nose of the spaceship will rise, but here it does the opposite. Also the yoke's lateral movement usually controls roll, but here it is yaw. I guess I'll just get used to face planting every time I take off, or eventually get around to remapping the controller.\\n\\nFlying out of the planet's atmosphere feels great, although space looks excessively bright, has way too many densely-packed asteroids that appear from nowhere, and planets are too close together. It's like flying through an impressionist painter's idea of space.\\n\\nI spend a few hours playing and I still need to get over my instinct to pull the yoke to go up, but that's not my biggest source of frustration. For a game that seems to be focused on collecting materials and crafting things out of them, managing inventories is confusing. Different categories of things such as raw materials, crafted stuff, deployable structures and upgrades all go in the same type of generic slot. They are not even color-coded in a way that makes any sense. The very limited slot count in the exosuit inventory is downright irritating.\\n\\nOn the subject of being irritated, I find myself staring at the laser beam that comes out of my multi-tool a lot longer than I would like to, not because I'm having a blood-pumping fight against some powerful antagonist. I fire the laser at a tree for a few seconds, the tree quivers and then it is gone. I fire the laser at a rock, the rock quivers and it is gone. I question my life's choices as I fire the mining laser at every inanimate object I find in order to get a trickle of materials that I can use to craft one annoying trinket after another that I need in order to accomplish the most basic of tasks.\\n\\nI set out on a boring quest to get fifty units of oxygen, ten units of sodium, a hundred units of copper, and three hundred units of iron to craft a metal pipe to hit myself repeatedly over the head in order to get enough brain damage so that I can continue playing.\\n\\nMost of the time I am not flying around enjoying the breathtaking scenery, anticipating the next adventure, trying to figure out some mystery or soaking in the story. Instead I am frantically running around trying to get more sodium, oxygen or copper in order to fix a valve in my suit through which my soul is being drained, Then I'll be able to look for something fun to do, maybe on the next planet, maybe on the next station. Before that happens I discover that I need to get more iron to craft another metal pipe because the first one broke after a hundred blows.\\n\\nMaybe this is not the right game for me. Maybe I don't care about collecting all the sodium, oxygen or copper that I can scavenge. Maybe I don't care about different but oddly similar alien dinosaurs or poisonous exploding plants. I don't care about wisdom stones that teach me a single word of some alien language. It's all such a boring chore that I'm going to take my helmet off the next time a radioactive super-heated storm hits so that I can put an end to my misery in the most painful way possible. At least I will get to feel something.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'If you\\'re getting this for space exploration your enjoyment meter is going to run out fairly quick. You will still get your money\\'s worth but you\\'re going to hit the \"seen it all\" wall quickly. If you\\'re buying this with the idea of base building, well then my friend, this is your game. As of the Beyond update the base building IS the end game. Me personally? I can\\'t stand base building. If I must do It, I construct the most basic building with only the essentials then I go right back to exploring. \\n\\nI used to love finding abandoned star ships and other poi with the signal booster. Well, that\\'s not working properly any more. It has become hit and miss and compounds the grind further. But hey, I should probably just go back to my base and grind it out for the power hook ups. Or maybe tame some useless creatures that serve zero purpose in the game. Man. They have definitely steered the game play more towards base building than anything else.\\n\\nSince the beyond update my frame rate has increased, but that comes at the price of draw distance. You see before Beyond, I had an acceptable frame rate and I almost never noticed items and textures popping into frame. Now? It happens directly in front of you. No matter what graphical settings I adjust, it still happens. Maxed or Low, doesn\\'t make a difference. Maybe it\\'s my setup you say? Well maybe? I have proper settings in Windows and Nvidia control panel and I\\'m using a well cooled 2080 ti. So as far as I can tell it is a problem and it\\'s not coming from my end.\\n\\nI wish there was a neutral value for reviews as I would assign this game one.\\nOnly get this game if it\\'s on sale at a good discount.',\n",

Although the fauna and flora are procedurally generated, they all look pretty much the same, the planets all have the same half dozen resources etc.\\nThe resource mechanic is poorly through out. It is largely grinding out the same few resources to use to grind away at trading, to get a better ship to allow you to grind away slightly faster. The whole thing feels like one of those terrible Idle-Clicker mobile games.\\nThe real killer though is the interface. It is poorly thought out and clearly designed for a console and badly retrofitted for PC. The interface system is counter intuitive and clumsy.

       "  'review': \"Played initially on PS4, bought this on PC exclusively to try out VR.\\n\\nI'm leaving this as feedback, it's not meant to be critical, and i'd like to point out that this review is especifically for the VR portion of the gameplay. The game itself is a nice sandbox, one of the best single player (Can't get friends to play this) sandboxes out there. The game itself deserves a positive review, but since I bought it on PC to try out VR especifically i'm going to point out the reasons that I are making it hard or unpleasant to play. I will gladly change if more options are added to acoomodate the VR experience.\\n\\nOk, here goes my comments:\\n\\nI usually play all VR games that require a lot of hours to get thru seated.  I adjust my height so it feels natural, sit down on a swivel chair, and my preferred motion scheme is smooth locomotion with smooth turning.  This works out GREAT in games like Skyrim and OrbusVR. It lets me sit comfortably, without losing any of the mobility that would be crucial to playing it properly, and at the same time allows for longer playsessions. \\n\\nNo Man's Sky tries to offer these locomotion settings, but the implementation is very poor at the moment. The sensitivity on the smooth turning makes it almost impossible to not get a little bit sick, it's just too sensitive, and its all or nothing. The games that do this best usually scale the turning speed to how far from the center of the touchpad your finger is. This lets you control exactly how you are turning, making the experience a lot better. \\n\\nAlso, let us use the left touchpad to move. Touching it to move, letting us strafe with it. If i press left on the touchpad it should strafe me left, up move forward, back move backwards. Ideally just the touch should move you, and if you press it should be considered a sprint.\\n\\nThis makes it SO much easier to move around, and gives you full control over the character. It goes a long way to make the locomotion smooth.  Pressing the trigger to move is so unintuitive, it makes it a pain to move around and feels AWFUL.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\nNow for the spaceship controls.  They are perfect in terms of responsiveness.  I really felt like I had the controls in my hand. My onloy comment is, usually when you are flying a ship with a stick, when you turn it left you expect to roll, and the touchpad should serve as a rudder, strafing the ship left or right. This should at least be an option. Would make it feel so much more real when flying.\\n\\n-----------------------\\n\\nAs for the survival experience I have one more comment to make. \\n\\nI've had a Vive for a while now, and the one thing that is a constant for me when I play a normal game that went VR, be it Skyrim, Falltout 4, or Subnautica, is that you spend a LOT more time letting the scenery kick in. It's a much slower pace, you aren't always in a rush to get into your destination. \\n\\nWhen I playing skyrim I think i spent an hour alone in bleak falls barrows, the first dungeon, it's just a TRIP to look at every little detail in the environment around you. \\n\\nConsidering this, it would be nice if you could spawn VR players in less hostile worlds for the first landing. You die at least once just trying to get a hold of the controls your first time spawning, because unlike PC you don't want to frantically go after supplies to stay alive, hopping from cave to cave. It would be nice to even walk to destinations instead of running, and its just too steep of a cliff to drop someone in when they are immersed like that. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I think it would make the beginning of the survival experience a LOT more VR friendly. \\n\\n\\nI will be happy to try this again if these changes are ever put into the game. As of right now, I couldn't stand to get past the survival experience in the beginning, and had to load a save to use a spaceship. I am dying to get into my character, but the immersion just goes away with these controls.\",\n",

I\\'ll sit in the same place, facing the same direction, and the UI is always way off to the left or right when I start a new game.\\n5) Want to crouch down to pick up something on the ground? Be prepared for the game to start whining that you\\'re out of the play space.\\n6) The HUD that is projected in your \"helmet\" doesn\\'t move with your head.\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty clear that the VR mode was developed for sitting on a couch with PSVR and never moving your head, ever. The game treats VR as a stationary screen, but on your eyes. There was really no mind for PC VR systems or standing up and moving around.\\n\\nEdit: The latest update made some of the visual issues more bearable, but I have more frame rate drops than previously. Also can say again for certain that the controls were not developed with PC VR systems or smooth movement in mind at all.\\n\\n1) You are able to punch things by actually punching them with your controller. But the way the game was programmed, moving into things using smooth movement also somehow counts as a punch. Want to visually inspect something by getting close to it? Forget it. You\\'ll destroy it.\\n\\n2) It\\'s especially tough to fly the ship. The game basically puts the throttle and control stick inside my legs. I\\'ve done everything I can to reset the seated position, but to no avail. Also, the stick position is relative to whatever direction you grabbed it with rather than using the controller\\'s absolute position. Did you grab the stick with the controller horizontally expecting the stick to move to horizontal? Forget it. Now horizontal is vertical. It doesn\\'t make any sense.\\n\\nThis is one of the worst VR experiences I\\'ve had.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll start with the positive things. The most important thing: I had some fun playing the game. When you start you have so much to explore and discover that it can get you hooked for hours. You can gather resources, scan, upgrade your stuff, participate in space battles... and it is amazing at the beginning.\\n\\nSo, why did I give the negative review?\\n\\nWell let\\'s start with the not so good stuff.\\n\\nI played with friends and laughed. Not because we had so much fun but because it was the only possible reaction to keep some of our sanity. The game is riddled with bugs, some minor and some game breaking and some seem like a bug but the game is apparently designed that way.  There seems to be a bug in every second main quest that you have to work around. Quite frankly, I have seen Early access games with less bugs.\\n\\nSome of the bugs encountered in 36 hours of gameplay for strictly single player:\\n[olist]\\n[*] Falling through the space station floor and ending up in space which makes the game crash a few seconds after.\\n[*]Losing all of your units when buying another ship by trading in your own ship even if you had a lot  more than needed.\\n[*] Randomly losing quicksilver currency (don\\'t even know when or why it happened)\\n[*] Main quest markers in the middle of space where you have to delete some party of your base to fix it\\n[*] Don\\'t even get me started on the quest line with the base computer, especially if you have more than one. You  can only do the quest at one of them but if you use a built portal to get there fast, the quest marker  keeps changing the computer, so you actually have to travel there by ship. oh and please don\\'t do time gated quests in a fucking (mostly) single player game. Needing over 15 hours to do a questline that could have been finished in 1 hour because of time gating just makes it seem like they need to do it to make it seem like there is more content.\\n[*]Animals bugging out and not doing anything\\n[*]Aliens on space station lying on the floor without you being able to talk to any of them\\n[*]Materials sometimes disappearing from refiners\\n[*]Visor showing resource deposits where there are none (and no, it was not already mined)\\n[*]Not getting money from bounty missions\\n[*]Getting stuck in landing animation and having to restart the game\\n[*] Starting a conversation with aliens sometimes doesn\\'t show any text\\nand many more...\\n[/olist]\\n\\nmultiplayer bugs:\\n[olist]\\n[*]getting desynced so that you don\\'t see your friend in game without restarting the game\\n[*]When inspecting/comparing ships, the same ships have different values and inventory slots for you than for your friend\\n[*]Bounties for pirates have different values for you than for your friend (doesn\\'t matter as you don\\'t get paid anyway and the moment someone of you engages the ships, they disappear for your friend, so you can\\'t actually fight together)\\n[/olist]\\n\\nmultiplayer \"features\":\\n[olist]\\n[*] you can\\'t use the trade terminal at the same time\\n[*] you can\\'t talk to the same merchant at the same time (which is not even needed for synchronisation as the merchant has a separate inventory for each of you)\\n[*] You don\\'t even do the main story quests together, you do them one after the other. If someone starts a dialogue, the other one can\\'t do the same until you are finished.\\n[/olist]\\n\\nMain story line:\\n\\nI like a good story but this main story line is particularly unengaging, boring and repetitive. Sure, I am only halfway through the main story, but during that half it felt like I was doing the same quests over and over again and doing the same stuff I was already doing when exploring planets  just with 4-5 lines of, sometimes scrambled, story text added to it.\\n\\nIf you still want to play the game, go ahead, I had at least some fun, but I would certainly recommend you to not buy it at full price.',\n",

Quite a lot of content though, so that is good. A few mods are also there, to fix a few things, although since updates break those, most of them are no longer working. Expected more after hearing all that praise online, not gonna lie. I wonder how it was just after release, if, apparently, it’s so much better now.\\n\\nOh, and also, colliders for buildings are way bigger than visuals, much worse than it was in Fallout NV, for example, so bullets get stuck. And enemies can shoot through walls and pass through buildings, especially those robodogs, so can’t really take cover from those to take a bit of a break.

       "  'review': 'TL;DR One of the worst, if not THE worst, single player experiences on Steam. One of the best, if not THE best, multi-player experiences on Steam.\\n$60? NOPE. $30? MAYBE. $15? TAKE MY MONEY!\\n\\nNot enough bad to be a \"No,\" but too much bad to be a straight out \"Yes\"\\n\\nThe UI isn\\'t that friendly as it places common commands/interactions behind several layers of navigation when they should really be a single keystroke, not to mention the menus are actually on timers (they will disappear on you after a few seconds of inactivity rather than closing on your command). This can be a pain early on when you have absolutely no idea where anything is in the menu or what it does. The tutorial leaves much to be desired as it has you do action-similar tasks step-by-step rather than giving an overall goal with a \"to-do list\" so you can complete the task more efficiently, e.g. repairing your starter ship, you are sent out to recover on component and then return to the ship for the tutorial to proceed to \"Step 2.\" Of course, you CAN go out and get all the materials, but only if you already know you can do this and know what you need to gather. \\n\\nVariety is SORELY lacking. I find this disconcerting as it was one NMS\\'s primary selling points. Planets quickly become indistinguishable as you slowly realize there are very few climates and only a handful of \"dangerous\" traits (I say \"dangerous\" because these hazards are easily overcome/avoided). Animals and plants are generally similar, although I don\\'t know if the common/uncommon/rare occurrence references the planet or the universe as a whole; you will find similar, even identical, species on multiple planets/systems. The limited selection in variations quickly leads to what seems to be copy-paste content despite being \"procedurally generated.\"\\n\\nCombat is lackluster. Animals are no real threat as most run off as you kill them. Sentinels, the primary defenders of valuable resources and commodities planet-side, are easily defeated/evaded; like GTA, just runaway or hide until your warrant level disappears and your back in business. Again, no real threat. Space battles aren\\'t that complex, they consist of pirates spawning because reason and you shooting them down. Their tactics are simple in that they speed straight towards you, aligning themselves to your line of fire, no aiming required. The random dogfight is hardly a fight as you simply sidestep, turn, and fire.\\n\\nResources are abundant and infinite; if you can\\'t find something just go to another planet/system, eventually you will find it in great supply. What makes them infinite is that they actually respawn after a short period. Find a rare mineral/resource? Hope you have the tech to mine it; be prepared to hold on to it as you\\'re going to have  to find a system with a station that values the find enough to pay you what it\\'s worth. Of course, having a freighter completely relieves the inventory concerns. Speaking of freighters...\\n\\nBase building is nearly pointless as far as I\\'ve experienced. Anything you can do on a base, aside from hiring a handful of aliens to \"work\" the base, can be done on your freighter which you\\'ll likely pick up in your first 10 hrs of play (10 hrs is a generous over-estimation as you will likely acquire one in the first system or two you explore). And if you DO decide to build a base, be prepared for physics defying overhangs, ugly corners, and unnecessary mechanics. All-in-all, this game sucks...\\n\\nThat is unless you\\'ve got some good friends to play with. While the game is incredibly tedious on your own, having a couple mates to fly around with adds a whole lot to the experience. Take you crew through system hoping adventure of discovery. Setup a mining colony to farm up some credits. Find and repair a crashed ship to add to your collection. Uncover the mysteries of the alien life forms that populate the universe. While these ALL deal with the negative aspects I find with the game, adding a multiplayer aspect is enough to gloss over those shortcomings. It has been my experience, however, that people don\\'t tend to trust those they don\\'t know in game so it doesn\\'t seem likely you will find many others willing to join up (admittedly this is anecdotal, but is accurate for the roughly 100 hours I\\'ve put into the game).\\n\\nIn summary, HG still has some serious work to do to make this the $60 title they promised at launch, but it is well on its way. For $30 you might consider picking it up if you have a few others to play with or don\\'t mind the mind-numbing repetition. On sale, it\\'s a definite buy.',\n",

The UI is bizarre at best and the flight mechanics are seriously lacking. I tried my best to enjoy it as I paid for it however I just couldn't get any fun from it.\\n\\nThe Flight mechanics (which I feel should be the main focus of the game) are absolute trash.

       "  'review': 'Edit September 02.2019:\\n\\nI stay with thumbs down. \"No Man´s Sky\" wants to be everything. Gather resources and build stuff; explore and survive; ground and ship fighting...\\n\\nThere are 54 \"raw materials\" and 81 \"crafted products\". And the list of \"raw materials\" even includes refined materials! You can get most on your first planet. Go to a hand full and you have everything. There could be so much more ...\\n\\nGathering resources and building: You can only build bases and the design does feel kinda limited. If you wanna build stuff, try \"Empyrion - Galactic Survival\" or \"Space Engineers\". There you can build whatever you want / can imagine (as soon as you get used to it). Those games do have their own flaws, the gameplay itself is mediocre, but in terms of building they show how it is done.\\n\\nExploring and survival: Try \"Subnautica\". Realy short, but so great. I am waiting for \"Below Zero\". This is a great example what exploring and survival can be like. Oh, and a good plot you can actually care for...\\n\\nFighting: I don´t know. But fighting in \"No Man´s Sky\" is lame! So I can buy a Class S Fighter? Cool! But I take down every single enemie with my class C Shuttle (I bought just for transport capacity)... I get hit, shields are reduced... and then they just recharge. I get hit again, reduced, recharged... and so on. Oh, how exciting....    Nope!\\n\\n\\nSo: You want all of this in one game and you don´t care if every single concept isn´t well thought out? Then you can try \"No man´s sky\". If you want one or another concept to be realy good: Maybe try something else.\\n\\nI wanted to try myself, and now I think I should have listened to all the bad reviews and skipped this. I mean if you do not care for the money (if you spend hundreds of $ each year on games) you can try this game any way. If you have little money to spend and you realy have to decide what to buy, I would advise you to buy another game.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOriginal: I enjoyed some hours, some hours where boring as hell, some where frustrating. After all I have a mixed fealing...\\n\\n\\nMy main complains are:\\n\\nI flyed from space station to space station. All looked pretty much the same. Then I ran around and talked to all aliens. Each space station has one or two \"individuals\", that ask for something and you can choose an answer out of 3 options. The impact is low, but OK. After some time you will find the same \"individuals\" all over again.\\nAll of the other alliens are pretty much the same. They say something to greet you, you can ask them to teach you a new word and they will. You could give a gift to raise your reputation with their race, doesn´t matter which one you give it. And you can practice your language, giving you the option to choose one of 4 words, of which none will ever do something good. It´s either wrong or terribly wrong, causing loss of reputation. And thats it...\\nI do understand they are not able to programm millions of individual aliens. I just wish there was more to it than it is now. After some time I stoped talking to aliens at all, cause it was just boring. It´s cool to have a huge universe with so many aliens, but as it is now, it´s just as bad as if there where none... They are just like soulless creatures I couldn´t care less for.\\n\\nI startet exploring my starting planet and scanned every mineral, every plant, every animal. I loved it, what a cool feature... Then I flew to the next planet and scanned a lot. Then the next... OK. That is kind of borring too... You get some units for it, but I don´t need those. You get the entry, with little information and a pic. I stoped doing that too.\\n\\nThe universe is so big. Yet it feels so empty.. (OK maybe this is how space actually is, I don´t know. But this is a game, this should entertain me somehow...)\\n\\nThere are some other, small problems that bother me. Like when I make a wooden room, place a weapons terminal and the back flows in the air. I think this might just be wrong placement. So I replace it. Can´t place it properly. I search the forums. Find an entry from one year ago... They don´t seem to care to fix those little cosmetic \"issues\"... This is not game breaking, of course. But it makes my base a bit ugly, and base building is one of the aspects I actuelly like. And I think such things could be fixed...\\nWhen I place a floor, place something on the floor and the I realise, it looks better if I rotate the floor, I can remove the floor, but I cannot add it back without removing the thing on it first.\\nAnd so on...\\nSmall issues that add up. Just enough to get on my nerves.\\n\\nAnd if you start reading problems other players have at the forums... oh my.... Maybe some comments overdo it a little bit, I don´t know. But the game seems to have some serious issues...\\n\\n\\nThere are good stuffs though:\\n\\nAs I said, I like the base building. I gathered resources, started building, removed, rebuilded. The grind was OK, now I am able to simply buy resources. I got more and more things to build, needed more resources to do so. This is what I expected.\\nOf course, I do not spend a lot of time at my base, but I still like it.\\nAnd I really love that you can actually get aliens to your base! Doesn´t make your base feel so empty. Aliens that do have a character! Aliens that are not only soulless creatures! Oh how I wish there where more of those! Why not more of those?\\n\\nNow, with those aliens at my base I got some side quests and something to do, thats is good.\\n\\nAnd I like the trading aspect. At every space station I write down what they buy and sell (not all of it, only what I think is important) and I make a route, planing how to get good income. I wish they where more individual though. If they like product z, you know they also like product y and x... If they sell product z, you know they also sell product y and x... I´d like them to shuffle that to make it more interesting. But nevermind, making money is still one of the fun aspects of this game for me.\\n\\nOther ppl seem to really love the game as it is. (I hope they don´t tear me apart for not loving it the same way.)\\n\\n\\nAfter all, hard to say if I like it overall, but I´d rather say no then yes at the moment, cause I think I had more time being bored or frustrated than enjoying the game...\\n\\n\\nBUT:\\nI have 40h of gameplay as I write this rewiew. I think 40h should be enough to get a picture of a game. But maybe the game gets better if I keep playing? Maybe there are still a lot of interesting things to come I have not realised yet? If so, I am gonna change my rewiew to positive...\\nBut as it is now, I go with thumbs down so far, for making me play and play and play just for the hope it gets better...',\n",

       "  'review': \"Thank God I got this game on sale, however, at this point that $30 something dollars is still burning me. \\n\\nI downloaded this game and played it fine, I got to play six hours of it in fact. The very next day I tried loading it up and nothing happened, it would say 'Running' and then 'Syncing' in the Steam Game Library and then it would just stop, nothing would happen. I updated my video card drivers, uninstalled and re-installed the game (three times), I even re-installed Steam. I also re-downloaded x64 from Microsoft. I had someone in detail help me out in the Steam forums with different possibilities such as my video card etc. and still nothing. I eventually found a YouTube video from last year stating if you unchecked the Steam Cloud save box it helped with the game not loading, still nothing. I then tried the experimental version of the game, still nothing.\\n\\nI have not been able to get this game to run for the life of me, and I have more than enough computer to run it. I even messaged Hello Games but all they said was to uninstall mods, I don't have any mods installed for the game. This has been the most frustrating and worst experience I have ever had with a game, ever. I guess I could play it on my PS4, but I would rather play a game on the PC any day of the week.\\n\\nAll I can do is hope that a patch comes out, or someone falls from the sky with an answer for me.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Гринд раде гринда без удовольствия.\\n\\nНа первый взгляд игра кажется очень разнообразной и красивой, но на практике 3-4 системы и уже видно что разнообразие планет не такое уж и разнообразие, две находящиеся рядом планеты друг от друго могут отличасть всего лишь какими нибудь каменными арками по всей поверхности а в остальном иметь туже траву, рельеф и т п. Позже замечаешь что тоже самое касается флоры, фауны и техники (особенно фрегатов). С другой стороны исследовательская составляющая весьма неплохая и если бы не низкое разнообразие и тот факт что очень много чего прикрыто гриндингом, я бы поставил игре другую оценку.\\n\\nТаже самая поверхностная красивость с игровым процессом. Сперва шахтеришь на terrain луч, потом на улучшенный добывающий лазер, затем на телепортер чтобы руду было сподручней на корабль скидывать, сканер чтобы искать подземные залежи и базы ставишь в местах где удобней ресурсы добывать. Тоже самое наблюдается с репутацией и миссиями. И если в начале все нормально, то чем дальше тем больше получается вечный и медленный гринд ради того чтобы делать все эффективней без резких качественных скачков, этот гринд не приносит чувства прогресса и следовательно удовольствия. Есть тут и интересные аспекты, но увы не много.\\n\\nСценарий... Что-то неоправданно жесткое для такого мира. Мне предложили туториаол по постройке базы, так как планета была никакая и игра явно поддерживала множественные сценарии, я отложил постройку до следующий системы, вот только спустя пару часов оказалось, что чотобы получить миссию на гипердрайв этот сценарий таки надо выполнить. Еще пример: сценарные миссии которые шлют делать что-то в течении часа и в награду дают чертежи которые уже есть или же превращают игрока в принеси-подай и без разницы что нанитов с запасом на любую покупку хватит- иди добывай еще и именно в этом месте. \\n\\nНу и наконец баги. Их вагон и маленькая тележка, приследуют игрока с самого начала. От глючных контейнеров и дронов застревающих под землей до разбивания корабля при взлете с торговой наземной станции и базы котрая вдруг потеряла половину всего оборудования..\\n\\nПо мелочи: торговля, но очень базовая. Управление флотом, опять же базовое (игрок может только купить фрегат, удалить или тыкнуть ему в миссию) и принципиально ни на что не влияет кроме небольшой прибыли.\\n\\nP.S. Для VR игра не очень подходит, она очень затяжная, хотя посмотреть пару мест из гарнитуры интересно.',\n",

I would rather spend hours in a dentists chair without anesthetic as said DDS uses every tool in his extensive set on my toothypegs than spend another second in this trash pile.\\n\\nTo say the game is dull is a complete understatement, dull is practically a glowing response to this desperately dim fare. Whilst planets may have different attributes every single one is same old same old. The art style is cute and saccharine, and like anything overly sweet will quickly bore the living shite out of you. After an hour or two in No Man\\'s Sky, if you\\'re not craving something meaty then you may want to get checked by a doctor, diabetes is a debilitating disease.\\n\\nFor a game with Space Flight in it, but not at it\\'s core, the flight model is akin to dragging an asthmatic elephant through treacle by it\\'s tail. It\\'s clunky, responseless, and downright unintuitive. While the game itself sounds great on paper the execution of the mechanics, the game loops, and the interminable grind for materials to advance makes it feel like Star Citizen and Minecraft hate-fucked and this is mutated progeny.\\n\\nAvoid at all costs.

       "  'review': \"It doesn't take more than an hour of game play to realize that this game has both an amazing potential and is a complete failure still this long after release... So here is the pro's and con's \\n\\nPros: Game has a lot to offer in terms of exploring its vast galaxy, varied planets, and style of survival game play. Even the story so far seems interesting and gives a player a sense of objective. The variety of items, ships, and even owning a freighter and a fleet of frigates gives the player a sense of the vast universe and power that can be achieved in the game.\\n\\nCons: There are tons of glitch's and bugs that occur while playing. Flying is not easy and combat with sentinels can be fun and annoying... Modding, Crafting, and resource gathering can become very overwhelming fast and having multiple bases in the same system seems to cause a glitch with the base computer quest... also if you go off course of the primary mission it seems you end up missing essential freebies that you end up buying by accident. Even short cut keys can be annoying at times since some are default attached to multiple actions in the same window. Lastly if your frigates get damaged on a mission you have to go land directly on that frigate, bring the right resources, and repair the individual damaged locations which could waste 10 minutes of your time running around the frigate to find and fix them... cool the first time... annoying every time after.\\n\\nTo go over all the minor problems and bugs in the game would be a novel and I am only 40 hours in now. They are not game ending bugs or issues but they certainly can cause you to reload a few times or regret building an entire base. For example finding out that certain industry level mining buildings glitch and do not allow to gather certain resources can ruin a base location you chose. Hopefully the developers are still working on fixing these problems but at this current point it becomes tedious at times to work around these issues...\",\n",

I don't care about base building or multi-player.  If the developers had any common sense, they would realize that those people who play the game in Creative Mode don't want these things. Creative Mode players want more assets in this procedurally generate universe and more variety of planets, biomes, plants, trees, fauna and animals etc. We're tired of the annoying messages that pop up all the time . Why can't we have the option to turn off these messages, they are destroying the ambience of the game. We should have the option to roll back any updates to go back in time to play the older versions of the game, since Hello Games doesn't care about the people who play in Creative Mode who only want to explore.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game has so much potential. Each update adds more features that are very exciting (that were promised before the game ever released). Yet, each update seems to add more and more bugs, while not removing much of the ones that already exist. The most recent big update is a disaster, I've run into more bugs than I would expect even in an open beta. I've reported each one I've run into, submitting the reports through the No Mans Sky support site, and of course I haven't received any acknowledgement of these being received, nor any suggestions from any support team on how to overcome the game breaking obstacles I've encountered. I've thrown away millions of credits worth of work with the number of times I've died, or had to revert to a save file anywhere from 5 to 60 minutes old because of the games archaic save system (how can you justify having no autosave when teleporting between stations?) \\n\\nTo date, here are some of the bugs that I've encountered:\\n\\n-After using the command station on my freighter, ended up noclipped in the ceiling of my freighter, when trying to move back down, fell through the freighter completely, falling endlessly through space, until I collided with an asteroid and died, losing a full inventory. \\n-Walked into an outpost on my friend's system, and my game immediately crashed as soon as I looked at the Galaxy Trade Network access, losing 10 minutes of work since the game did not save anything recently \\n-Ended conversation with Mission NPC in space station, camera stayed glued to the NPC while I had control of my character. Due to my last save being 30 minutes earlier, I spent 5 minutes blindly controlling my character until I was able to successfully interact with the NPC again\\n-Camera got glued to a portal in a space station, could control my character but could not see them. Ended up walking off the edge into the area with space ships, was unable to recover by interacting with an NPC/object to reset UI, was forced to revert save, losing 40 minutes of trading progress. \\n-After trying VR (And hating it, the controls and performance are both rubbish) I returned to non-VR and the VR Guidance pop-ups have remained ever since. I have about 20 hours of game play with the bottom right corner of my screen telling me how to access the menu in VR by pointing my right hand to my left. Not game breaking, but absolutely obnoxious. \\n-Flew into the Anomaly to land, space ship ended up skipping around the station spinning erratically. Ended up seeing multiple players with this issue. Lost 30 minutes of progress. \\n-Found an abandoned base filled with alien eggs, shot the eggs from a long distance away which triggered the Abominations to spawn, which walked around normally then fell through the ground and immediately teleported to me, killing me instantly. full inventory lost. \\n\\nThis game has a lot of potential for fun, especially with friends, but is such an enormously buggy game that I still cannot recommend. If you do decide to play it, I strongly recommend carrying around portable save points & use your ship every time you change station. I'd also recommend not carrying around anything valuable in your inventory, because you never know when you're going to clip through something and die. \\n\\nTL;DR Fuck this game\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought this game launch day in 2016. Was fascinated for the 60+ hours I spent on it. I had come to the point where I could either 1. get to the center of the galaxy using hundreds of time consuming warps or 2. Find that illusive Atlas pass v3. I didn't have the patience for either after researching online what each rewards you with. \\n\\nJump to 2019 with the Beyond update. Sure, the game is far more polished with more to collect, build, farm, and upgrade but the end experience is still the same: It takes an eternity to reach the center of the galaxy (the only true goal in the game) and the only reason to collect and upgrade is to... collect and upgrade. This game has no conclusion, no progressive difficulty, and a story so vague and paper thin that you'll lose interest in it within the first hour or two.\\n\\nThat's not to say the game isn't worth playing. I've had some legitimately memorable moments with this game (finding an amazing looking planet, running into another player randomly, traveling 20 minutes to a facility and back on foot because I thought I needed to all while surviving the elements), but once the veil falls and you realize that this game is essentially just loading one random set of 1-5 planets with the same space station and the same randomized ships and randomized multitools and randomized but re-occurring fauna and flora every time you warp then the game feels incredibly small and meaningless. \\n\\nFor this reason I cannot recommend this game. Another game will come along by a AAA developer that does what NMS does but 100x better with a proper story and challenge.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought this game after the beyond update. I think that it a great game overall. However i don't think that i have ever played a game that contains this much bugs. Unfortunately it also contain a lot of game breaking bugs. You can lose your base, your money, your inventory access, your freighters. All the things that took a long time to collect, build, create. A game that has this many serious issues three years after release, should not be sold. \\n\\nMy last gaming session before i finally quit:\\n-Logged in, noticed that all my quicksilver was gone (currency type)\\n-Went to my base. Tried to get something from storage. Kept saying 'inventory full'. Which was not the case.\\n-Tried to rebind my keys, however if you go to the configuration screen it shows no bindings at all..\\n-Went through a portal and the game crashed.\\n\\nIt could be a great game,but it is a train wreck at the moment and i do not think that this can be fixed. This is caused by flaws in the game design. When they fix one thing, they will break something else. I hope that they can get it right, but i strongly recommend NOT buying the game at this moment!\",\n",

I can't mentally give it enough time to get off the first planet as I already know what I'll be in for - more tedious farming of elements on boring planets for upgrades that let you survive or move in a way that's slightly less tedious. I just finished Subnautica and loved it, so this isn't me not liking the genre, this is me not liking a half baked, super boring game.\\n\\nThe gameplay: Crash landing on a toxic planet, looking for element, can't find element, die. Rinse / repeat a few times. I have no idea why I'm on this planet, the movement is horrendous (can't sprint for more than 3 seconds, camera position is awful, jet pack essentially useless), the finding/collecting of elements is snooze worthy. Even if I were to complete the first planet of this clunky snooze fest and repair my ship I'm certain mostly tedious farming on boring planets would await me... \\n\\nGod no, get subnautica, and if you played/liked subnautica don't ruin the genre for yourself with this steaming pile of garbage.\",\n",

Beyond just the bugs making this unplayable even when saving at all opportunities, such as the space anomaly drifting bug, the freighter phase-through bug, and more than I could mention about the construction bugs, there are many features implemented that are often just hostile to the player.\\n\\nBase-building is a chore at best and involves plodding through many dialogue prompts hoping that the next will actually bring progress rather than another pointless and unskippable non-sequitur, all while many crucial base components are missing from your blueprints, such as a door being required to enter a hab-pod, but if it is powered, it remains shut. This would not be a problem if the blueprint for a door switch weren't locked behind several branches of a tech tree. Another issue with bases arises from any plot that must be excavated, with the excavation tools not only being an absolute ball-ache to use, but with there also being the chance that your plot will once again be buried by the pointless terrain regeneration. Any desire to slightly modify the arrangement of base components requires deleting the component in question and hoping you have the inventory space to hold the refunded materials. All of this for the privilege of powering a storage pod that is also a chore to access without the ability to take with you anywhere like those that may be installed on a freighter.  The only tangible benefit from using a base is ground vehicle deployment, which requires a base on any planet you wish to use them on, which is a far cry from being a net positive result of the system.\\n\\nAll of this and more considered, I can honestly say I prefer the launch build of the game; it may have had problems, but that was from lack of content, not nigh-malign additions.\",\n",

There are storage bugs, bugs where you will fall through the floor of your main ship, bugs where you will lose your ship while paying full price for another, bugs in conversation scripting and item delivery, bugs in item operation, bugs in item interaction.\\n\\nThere are poor coding decisions where you can consume an item to look for local instances of a certain type of building/item where if it is not found, the item is still consumed rather than returned. There are issues with occasional hard-faults. There is a manual-save function in the game which forces you to either build or bring a save structure to everywhere you go to save. It is necessary to save prior to any important interaction because of the bugs in the game. While playing this game you get used to taking steps to ensure you can backup to previous states and lose a fair amount of time.\\n\\nAs it is, this game is aggressively average.\\nIf time was taken to correct all of the bugs in this game it would be good.\\nIf the game had been coded to be massively-multiplayer and were bug-less it would be great.\",\n",

(I know what you\\'re thinking, but no; it literally did not allow me to interact with it. I held E and the white circle filled up, but then it didn\\'t open the menu. It also didn\\'t allow me to pick it up again.)\\n- After restarting the game, in an attempt to fix the previous bug, it no longer allowed me to play multiplayer because according to NMS there was not a single lobby, even though friends were definitely in one. They were also unable to invite me.\\n- To try and fix the previous problem, I continued my save file in singleplayer to make an attempt at making progress. I finally was able to use the refinery and I actually made some progress! I then yeeted myself to the next planet, where the game crashed when trying to load some text. Straight to desktop.\\n\\nFantastic.\\n\\n(Aside from this, I feel like it runs way worse than it should, but I don\\'t really have anything to back that feeling up with so I might just be overlooking something.)',\n",

Although, the main issue here isn't the content, but the inconveniences and poor functioning. To begin, there are frequent crashes that cause me to loose an hour of progress, (ex. building a base) where the only point of return is if you're lucky enough to be in your ship beforehand. I don't have much time in my day to be repeating lost progress. One issue that really bothered me, and a mistake I made multiple times, is fueling refiners and power generators without loosing 1,000+ of carbon on accident. Where it only lets me use the entirety of it, regardless if I separate it into smaller stacks. I could list more, but I would highly recommend listening to the community closely and fixing these. Besides that, the idea is really cool and I would have loved to involve more of my time into the game's future content. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this game at the moment, it still requires a lot of work and the attention should be more surrounded by making the game playable before adding new content. I do acknowledge and appreciate the effort in trying to revive this, yet sadly it's still lacking.\",\n",

So everything I am about to say is related to the VR version of the game since I have not played the regular version at all. \\n\\nNot that I played the VR version either, all the time played that you see above has been spent trying to get this unoptimized mess of a game to run semi decently wihout reprojection or shimmering pixelated jaggies everywhere.\\n\\nAfter a week of troubleshooting I can safely say I am giving up. I cant get above 45 FPS with a GTX 1080 and an i7 9700k, I have followed every guide, done every potential fix but it looks like the VR PC version of this game has been given literally 0 thought and slapped on just to reach a broader audience of wallets. I am trying to run this on a Valve Index, I have not tried other headsets with it.\\n\\nThis is a PSVR port that runs like shit, looks like shit and is unplayable as of mid August. If this changes I will change my review, but I am not holding my breath.\\n\\nEdit as of November: \\n\\nLiterally nothing has been fixed, its still a disaster. Don't bother with this.\",\n",

I thought I bought a game that was released in 2016, instead I got a game which seems it hasn't even been released to beta-state yet. Trying to play a game that seems more like I'm trying out a pre-alpha is a disgrace.\\nI played the game pre-Beyond, when it was (still) a buggy mess, but it was still more or less playable. But after, it just broke my heart and soul, to think I tried my best to trust the promises of a company that has not been able to deliver anything they've promised since day 1.\\nI might return some day in the distant future, to see if they've delivered finally a game worth the 31€ that I bought this game with. The hell I'd pay the full 60€ for a disgrace like this.\",\n",

Even though this is supposed to be fixed, shooting a freighter even once while trying to defend it will still call in sentinels to attack you. I'm 8 hours into a new game and I still have annoying tutorial pop ups constantly- I have already installed several upgrade modules but every 2 minutes i get a big pop up telling me to install another one even though my multi-tool doesn't have room.

       "  'review': 'The worst game I have ever played. I bought it last year in August and still can´t play it, because remapping of buttons doesn´t work.\\nThe main problem is deleting stuff. So as a newby I collected too much and my inventory is full, which requires me to discard something, which is not possible. The delete action is tied to pressing mouseweel, which doesn´t work for me. Rebinding it also doesn´t work, regardless what button I choose it always resets to standard setting immediately.\\n\\nWell, when I bought the game I thought this might be fixed at some point, since rebinding keys is kind of an important feature, right? No? Well, it doesn´t seem to be important for these devs, since it still doesn´t work.\\n\\nSo I can´t play the game! Thx at Hello Games! Great devs..\\n\\nI can´t express in words how much I regret buying this game, for me it´s scam from both Hello Games for not fixing gamebreaking issues and Steam, from Steam because they don´t refund me this game although it has a serious technical issue that prevents me from playing it. \\nI tried to explain to the steam support that I can´t proceed to play this game due to this issue but they do not even read what you write. They just look at the playtime and how long you own the game, which is not fair at all, since the problem occured after the refund period of two hours and I just waited to see if the developer fixes the issue, which he didn´t in over half a year.\\n\\nWhere I come from consumers are protected against such shady anti consumer practices but on Steam everything is possible as it seems.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't recommend NMS at all right now, as it has become an insanely tedious grind fest that never stops. Every single step you take in this game requires some sort of grind, BREATHING requires a grind for materials. You have to spend 5 minutes of mining just to build one room for a base. Oh you upgraded to a cool moon rover that you can take around and mine things with? Awesome except for the fact that you use up so many damn resources in the process that all you're going to be able to do is mine for more fuel to power the thing which you need to go get more materials so that you can THEN put those stupid materials in a refiner to make one component of a base then do it all over again.\\n\\nHello Games you need to release some of the grip on players. Yields need to be doubled or mats required to build things need to be halved. You ave made the game waaaay too complicated for it's own good  to the point that it's pushing new players away. There is nothing fun about spending a half hour mining stuff just to get to the point where I can buil a few things for my base. It wasn't nearly this complicated in the beginning. Every single update has changeed things so much, for no apparent reason, that we have to relearn the game every time. It's time consuming, tedious, complicated, things to play out smoothly meaning that you could go days of playing without acquiring certain necessary tools to make things A TAD bit faster. \\n\\nLearn from Subnautica, a far superior base building/survival game in a very similar style, that things DON'T NEED TO BE SO DAMN COMPLICATED TO BE FUN. Strip the stupid refiner out of the game, make things require raw mats to end the nonsensicla amount of steps it takes to build things, so that I can go out and do things that are FUN like exploring and base building, upgrading tools etc.\",\n",

The New Patch Today Made It Worse. My Hope is They are in Studio Working right now on Fixing this Game. It will be fun. VR Yesterday worked fine. BUT it has problems too. Played last night after VR in flat Panel mode and had a good time. Today it Patched and so far has caused 12 Crashes lol  it's Broken. Don't pay full price on this Game yet. Or do if you have faith they will get it right. I feel bad that after a new patch Today it's so much more worse then before. Sad but True. Make up your mind it's your Money. I think it will be fun if they can fix it. I run a AMD 7 and a RTX 2070 Factory OC Gigabyte Card with 16 G of System Mem. I have changed all the settings to run tests on my system to give it the CHANCE to work. It Didn't. IT's Broke for now.\",\n",

There have been 4 patches at least at writing this after the Main update and not one of them has addressed the obvious game breaking flaw that this game has, nor have the developers acknowledged it to the customers who bought it. None of the key binds will work. It\\'s impossible to rebind the keys or even see what the keys functions are in game. The most basic of things a game requires has been ignored to work on graphic glitches while leaving the game completely unplayable without even a mention of whether it will be patched or not. The game is completely uncontrollable with the keyboard. \\n\\nI had limited time to request a refund from Steam for this game that should be renamed \" Beyond Broken \" so couldn\\'t waste time gambling on whether the developer would even reply to customers who have reported the problems to them or try to patch it. I received my refund and washed my hands of it. Don\\'t waste your money on this, any developer who ignores customers complaints constantly doesn\\'t deserve the custom.',\n",

I just hope they keep on making it better so i can someday change this review.\\n-A lot of bugs that affect gameplay, some really badly.\\n-Exploring the planets is the very idea of the game but way procedual generation works on this is that everything is basically the same with different flavors. There are no really high or low places ,worlds\\' \"bottom\" is really close to the surface and everything is spread out quite evenly so different areas of the planet are pretty much the same. \\n*A lot can be remedied with mods\\n-each planet has its own ecosystem which is good ((flora,fauna,geology)all of it can be renamed). They all might be gray placeholders because not one of their traits mean anything which is bad. Also all planets have some default plants which always look and function the same and can be renamed as if they were something new. Not horribly gamebreaking but very lazy in game that is all about exploring and finding new things.\\n-you can\\'t stop with your ship. You literally can\\'t stop unless you land.\\n-lack of enemies.On planets there are these robot things called sentinels, some wildlife can be aggressive (so far they have just charged and tried to swipe), some plants (the default ones that are always the same) can do damage. Thats about it that I have seen so far. Maybe there are more closer to the center but i doubt it.\\n-I think base systems(there are 3, planet, capital ship and spacestation) have still unclaimed potential.\\n\\nThere are also a lot of good things about the game, but you can read about them on the other reviews.\\n\\nConsidering how badly this game launched yet still the devs persisted there is still hope for the game to live up to its hype.\\nIts now at 50 / 100 on my scale.',\n",

There are so many quality of life updates that could massively improve this game. Being able to skip through dialogue would be a great first start. Having to wait through roughly 10 seconds of some stupid text box saying the same damn thing 20 times while you trade in navigation data for maps is just idiotic. Who designed that and then proceeded to ignore the criticisms from no doubt thousands of people?\\n\\nThe glitch where you can lose control of your bases are also great fun. I enjoy losing progress just because I used a portal on the nexus. I saw people posting about that back in 2016. How does a game just utterly fail to fix major bugs like that and somehow still put out major content updates? My mind is boggled. I luckily was able to recover my base by reloading a save, so I guess this game is somehow more reliant on stability saves than some 20 dollar minecraft in space game made in unity like empyrion.\\n\\nOn top of the above, progress is slow and fairly unrewarding. The only big jumps appear to be unlocking prefab rooms which are the only ones where the more advanced tech can be placed for some reason and buying a freighter.\\n\\nAt least it looks cool.\",\n",

When I pay £40 for a game, I expect to be able to play it with, at the very least, some stability. I did NOT pay £40 just to waist 40 hours building up a base, collecting materials and doing missions only to have what I had worked so hard on taken away at an instant because Hello Game's developers can't code a game correctly. Base building on Fallout 3 RTS was so much more dependable.\\n\\nNow I will prehaps go back to this game later, because it has a lot of potential, and I genuinely want to enjoy it, but right now? It is remaining uninstalled for a while until this base bug is patched out. Which it better be.\\n\\nEdit: Want to give this game another chance, for the 5th time, so I guess I'm going to start a new save I think and cut my losses.\\n\\nEdit2: I feel depressed when ever I play this game.\\n\\n5/10\",\n",

There's one there)\\n\\n Things are either bad or Drove me crazy:\\n1)Still major glitches (Example the entire space station and anomoly disappeared leaving me floating in midair)\\n2)Don't bother building anything worth keeping. Twice in two days it has taken away my base setting it to guest) That means no additional building allowed)\\n3)Don't bother with the storage vault its huge with only a capacity for 5 items and it requires power to put things in and get things out.\\n\\nIt's come along way since it's initial release. These errors especially no.2 have been known to the community based on a recent search for awhile. Which means the either the developers don't care or don't know how to fix. Either way this makes part of the enjoyment of this game obsolete. Not sure how this breaks since the base computer has your name as the last person to edit. So I'm pretty sure a check that matches the current player name to the base last edited name to determine the players permission to edit should be simple logic to incorporate. Even putting a claim button to relink it should.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I really want to like this game a lot, and I have thought long and hard about whether to dip my toe in again, but can't bring myself to do so. The biggest problems for me, ones others have touched on, are too big to ignore. It's a really huge grind, and things feel tacked on just to keep you grinding. Dumb enemies without any personality, like the repetitive Sentinals, who are just there to annoy you at every turn (cos who doesn't like being harassed continuously while they try collecting and building) dampen any previous enthusiasm. I'd not mind as much if there was more variety of challenging enemies, which had various ways to deal with them.\\n\\nThe universe lacks personality, and in fact the biggest problem with it, is there's too much of everything.\\n\\nYOU SEE SOOOO MUCH. The emptiness of space is not depicted here, it's teeming with life, and so things become stale very quickly. If Hello had the nerve to hold things back, there might be genuine excitement when discoveries are made, out of the blue. Always knowing that there are things out there no-one has seen, waiting to be discovered, is what makes games like these special, it's why we enjoy them. But here, everything is thrown at you right from the off. Holding back is great, but only if you are giving us things that don't become wallpaper, and things that seem (even if they aren't really) unique. \\n\\nIt's a shame because there is a lot to love about the game, but in it's eagerness to give us lots of stuff, we only really get a small amount of genuine surprises, and a heck of a lot of chores to do.\\n\\nNote: Recently came back to this game to try the VR aspect. Turns out that the VR component is a jerky, stuttering, horrible mess on my Oculus Rift S/RTX 2070. I have good VR experiences generally, even if not always perfect, but here it was unplayable no matter what settings I changed. Oh don't forget to remember - every time you change a graphical setting, you have to restart the game, aagh! \\n\\nGreat potential.... maybe one day.\",\n",

But then I heard that the game was fixed, that the devs put in the extra hours to deliver on their promises, so I decided next time it was on sale I would give it a chance. Well I just picked it up for 30 USD and after twelve hours of play I feel nothing short of sucker punched. I am a busy individual, with only on average about 20 hours of recreational time a week. I spent twelve of those hours this week enjoying this game, only to find a damaged craft, attempted to add it to my collection, and wind up stuck with no working ship in the middle of bumf**k nowhere with no resources and no way to reload an earlier save except for one from all the way back at about half an hour into my playthrough.\\nTo be clear, if i was working on something for my job for the same amount of time I lost, I could have bought the game 6 times over. Since I value my free time, that is the value I blame this game for removing from my life.\\nIn hindsight, worst purchase ever.

Hell i dont even like Roguelike/lite that much and after 1 hour in i already knew this was something special. I dont wanna spoil anything but let me tell you this. \\n\\n* Impressive art style that fits in every pixel of your screen. Its lovely, its distinct and its gorgeous\\n* Combat feels something like Diablo or twin stick shooters from back in the day but everything here is more fluid. every button press is instant\\n* The game has great voiceovers (all interactions are voiceovers wich is impressive because the immersion is off the chart in this game)\\n* Great RPG elements that has different rarity and a unique playstyle for most of the runs u do, \\n* Just great systems that work in a clever manor choosing between Reward or convenience. Gold or Life. \\n\\nI can write for hours because this game made me realise how much i miss the surprise factor that almost no Triple A games give these days. For me this game is a solid 9.5/10 and i hope to see lots of more content in the near future! \\n\\nLove from The Netherlands',\n",

       " b'Hades ist ein gutes Spiel... Aber es ist kein gutes Supergiant Spiel.\\n\\nOder anders, [b]f\\xc3\\xbcr mich haben sich Supergiant Spiele bisher immer durch eine ausgezeichnete Mischung aus Story und Gameplay ausgezeichnet[/b]. \\n\\nHades aber geht einen anderen Weg: [b]es stellt das Gameplay vorne an und ordnet die Story diesem fast vollst\\xc3\\xa4ndig unter[/b].\\n\\nDabei entsteht dann ein Spiel, dass zwar viel Spa\\xc3\\x9f zum spielen macht, aber keine emotionale oder gar mitrei\\xc3\\x9fende Story erz\\xc3\\xa4hlt. Noch schlimmer, weil man im Vergleich zum erleben der Story einen \\xc3\\xbcberw\\xc3\\xa4ltigenden Anteil der Zeit mit nicht story-relevanten K\\xc3\\xa4mpfen verbringt, geraten die nach wie vor gut geschriebenen Texte noch weiter in den Hintergrund. Dabei hilft es dann leider auch nicht, dass die Vertonung gut ist.\\n\\nEbenfalls nicht so gut wie bei Bastion, Transistor und Pyre finde ich den Soundtrack: weniger markant, weniger abwechslungsreich, weniger tolle Vocals.\\n\\nDann merkt man leider auch, dass die Entwickler hier Elemente aus z.B. Bastion recycling: von Gegner-Designs, \\xc3\\xbcber Animationen und Gameplay-Details. Hades ist ein behutsames Update von dem, was schon Bastion geboten hat, minus der Story.\\n\\nJa, das Spiel ist noch nicht fertig und daf\\xc3\\xbcr hat es schon durchaus eine zufriedenstellende Menge an Content. Dennoch zweifle ich daran, dass man noch eine Story auf dem Niveau eines Pyre oder Transistor erz\\xc3\\xa4hlen wird.\\n\\n\\n[b]Fazit:[/b] wer das Spiel vor allem wegen dem Gameplay kauft, der kann hier absolut bedenkenlos zuschlagen. Wer aber Story, Charaktere und Emotionen erwartet, der wird entt\\xc3\\xa4uscht werden und schaut sich besser etwas anderes an.\\n\\n\\nPS: wenn das Spiel fertig ist, werde ich es noch mal spielen.

       " b\"the good: This game is absolutely incredible. It takes the experimentation and near infinite build possibilities of other rogue-likes and combines it with a solid narrative and great characters, as well as an ever-evolving story as you learn more and more about the world. Currently 5 weapons (soon to be 6 apparently) with several forms of each, as well as countless different upgrades you can take each run based on what god you speak to. Build possibilities are nearly endless, combat is fluid, fast paced, and satisfying, art is incredible and stunning. \\nthe bad: Obviously it's in early access, and while the game is fantastically well polished, there ARE some bugs here and there that might annoy you. Not to mention some things are still being balanced, so don't expect all builds to be viable. There's no graphics options other than resolution, and while the game IS easy to run, I question how any game in 2020 could have no graphics options on PC. Finally, some of the in game economies still need some balancing, the big one being Titan Blood, which you need to upgrade weapons and unlock new forms. I HIGHLY suggest getting a mod to reduce upgrade costs.\\n\\nOverall, this game is absolutely amazing, and well worth what's being asked for it.

The combat is very addicting, with 4 weapons to choose from. Each weapon has up to 4 \"aspects\" you can equip (as of the Long winter update, the spear is the only one with 4 aspects), which change the gameplay loop significantly and offer a variety of  choices on how to approach. \\nBoons from the gods, which help the young prince Zagreus  escape from this hell, change how you tackle your current attempt as escaping. \\nMaybe you prefer the mighty zeus and his lightning-chain based attacks? Or you enjoy raining down big numbers through the crit-based boons of the goddess of the hunt, artemis? The choice is up to you.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is a treat to enjoy, and in my opinion the biggest enjoyment are the characters itself: Each character - from the inhabitants of the House of hades, the bosses or the gods of olympus - have a variety of dialogue, referring to one other or even talking amongst them.\\n\\nA TL;DR Version: I highly recommend playing it due to the following reasons: \\n\\nAmazing gameplay loop\\nWide Variety of choices (Weapon upgrades, boons, aspects, keepsakes)\\nAmazing soundtrack\\nChallenging Bossfights\\nAdjustable difficulty through the Pacts of Punishment (Available after clearing the final boss the first time)\\n\\nOh and also: You can pet the dog.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " b\"This game isn't finished as of yet. And it's absolutely wonderful. I'm a fan of games like this where each run has so much variety. I enjoy being able to swap between all the weapons which adds quite a bit of variety in playstyle, I like the weapon upgrades per run that also make each run different as you try to mix and match synergistic combinations. Runs don't get stale gameplay-wise as they inevitably change as you get buffs and weapon upgrades each run which alter how you try to deal your damage to enemies and avoid their strikes. \\n\\nI like the heat mechanic added in after finally making it out the first time as well. Adds so much more replayability as you can to choose how the game gets even tougher! The upgrades all feel meaningful and effective both inside and outside of runs. I can't wait for this game to get even more content! Definitely incredibly fun for anyone who enjoys this genre and likes fast paced action. \\n\\nDid i mention that it's awesome to be able to pause the game? It's great to be able to pause the game and leave it open for any amount of time. I've come back 2 days later to finish a run I was in the middle of before because I got busy. Just a really nice quality of life thing, doesn't take up much cpu or anything either.

As others have said it honestly feels like a full release game despite being in early access, and dying and losing your progress through the levels is not near as frustrating here as I've found it in other games. The art design is outstanding (though this isn't too much a surprise considering the great work that's been done in the developer's other games, such as Transistor) and the attention to detail is outstanding. In addition some elements that are a bit less rewarding (such as Darkness, a form of currency to level up your character between runs) are being actively worked on along with further content being added--and every dialogue line is voiced! I've rarely seen that in high-budget triple A titles, nevertheless something from a smaller developer. Now that this is available on Steam (rather than exclusive to another platform...) I would absolutely recommend this.\",\n",

It's not very varied but what keeps me going are the dialogues and the background story, peppered with references to greek mythology.\\n\\nThe game has the same distinct sound fx, music and art design that are the trademark of the developpers, Supergiant Games.

       " b'Wonderful game! Can\\'t wait to see what it\\'s like on full release.\\n\\nCombat is tight and fun, enemies seem fair and balanced for the most part. Most bosses feel completely OP when you first fight them but the more you fight them the more you see their patterns and realize what you need to do. My one complaint would be the artifacts seem poorly balanced, The artifact that gives a percentage of health back when picking up Darkness seems very strong (a good thing) but most of the others don\\'t seem all that useful. I only have about half of the Artifacts unlocked so some of those may be strong as well. Haven\\'t completed a full run yet so that also may change things.\\n\\nThe perk that gives 10% damage when your cast is in the enemy is a game changer, level that one up as early as you can.\\n\\nOverall a wonderful game! I\\'ve spent most of my time since I purchased it playing, has been stealing time away from my other games. Even after a bad run if I decide to take a break I\\'ll usually go watch a video to get some ideas to beat whatever I\\'m stuck at and that will make me immediately want to play more. Definitely a \"one more run\" game.\\n\\nI was concerned that there wouldn\\'t be enough content when I purchased it but I would personally view this as a complete game if no one told me otherwise.

If you like Greek mythology and you enjoy story in your Roguelike, this is a great fit. Albeit, you don't need to read/listen to any of the dialogue, which makes it fit both bills. Every line in the game has dialogue to it (I think), which makes the game even more enjoyable to me. Although, it is in early access, so the amount of endgame content that doesn't include doing the same few levels is not there yet. I am looking forward to future updates to this game, which will hopefully include more gods/goddesses, new enemies/levels, and more content in the endgame.\",\n",

The characters in Hades also make the world and your journey way more dynamic and interesting. The amount of voice lines the different gods (or other npcs) have is actually astounding, even after 20 hours i feel like I've not heard anything twice.\\n\\nThe progression is also extremely satisfying with passive bonuses that you upgrade. And those passive bonuses don't really make you that much op, which is very nice. In this game, you feel the progress quite a lot, even if you die, you feel like you progressed, which is something a lot of games don't achieve. \\n\\nBosses are quite well done as well. They also have great lines and you even have few variations of one boss, which makes the journey not as repetitive and keeps things fresh. I didn't feel like there were any bad designs or anything of that kind, so i'd say well done here.\\n\\nOverall, This game, even in early access, is almost as good as Dead Cells. I don't think it has the more long term progression Dead Cells has, but it's just early access so it makes sense. It also has the story, characters, that make the world feel more alive and dynamic, which is something Dead Cells doesn't really have, so in that regard it actually triumphs over it. \\n\\nIf you like Roguelike games, this is a must buy. You will get tons of hours of great content with great characters and progression that keeps you playing for a while.\",\n",
       " b\"This is a really fun and interesting game, the god mode feature is a great addition, good to use of you wanna finish the game and enjoy the story, but also have fun along the way. The game is easily enough of a challenge with or without god mode. \\n\\nThere are plenty is unique powers, weapons and trinkets what help you develop different tactics for the boss fights, without making game play too easy. The sound has been done extremely well, the music in the boss fights gets the blood pumping and each time you die, you're motivated to make it further than last time.\\n\\nThe voice acting is an actual joy and each character is very well distinguished as well as being fun to converse with. Overall i think it's a fantastic game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to test their skills in a dungeon style game! I will give this game a 9/10! \\n\\nI hope this review helps other gamers who have taken an interest in this game but are yet to make up their minds.\",\n",

Each weapon works better with certain boons compared to others and gives a whole new different play style. \\n\\nThe flow of combat is really awesome, with the wall bashing, pushing enemies into traps, deflecting their attacks, or even making debris fall on them. I loved dashing around with the  shield and ramming enemies into walls and lava. It was so satisfying just pushing them around into explosions or lava.\\n\\nThe story progression is really good as well, almost all the characters really feel for you and wanna help you which kind of in turn adds sympathy toward Zagreus, personally. The backstory is really intriguing the more it's uncovered. The more you die the more dialogue you uncover which is a nice touch.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that with the Titan Blood, being the hardest to get, I was really hoping for better upgrades. Especially the ones that cost two Titan Blood. There are maybe one or two upgrades that I actually liked. That is just my opinion and others may think otherwise.\\n\\nOverall I love this game a lot and would highly recommend it. I can't wait what they do next as they further update the game. I wish I could add more to this review because there is just so much that is great about it but I am really not good at reviews yet (this is actually my first one I believe). Sorry if this review was a bit shit :P\",\n",

The voice acting and adaptations of Greek mythological characters are really well done (seriously, there are endless snippets of well written dialogue) which leads to a surprising amount of character development (flavour). My favourite is Poseidon, what a bro. \\nThe gameplay is fantastic and incredibly satisfying. There's plenty in the way of weapon (ranged and melee) and build variety so each run is interesting, and the various permanent upgrades keep you motivated to get out and find more resources to trade. \\n\\nThe development team have a clear road map, make frequent large updates and have plenty more they want to add before the full release.

       " b\"[strike]It's okay I guess.[/strike]\\n\\nYou would not know this game was in early access if the devs didn't mark it as such. I know they've been working on it for a long time, but everything about this game is perfect. \\n\\nDisclaimer: I have never played a roguelike game before this one, and it sets the bar pretty high. It's only taken me so long to write a review because I was a little busy...\\n\\nThe artwork in this game is stunning. The colors, the environments, all of it is gorgeous. Darren Korb knocks it out of the park with the soundtrack once again. As he does with the voice acting, too! Each character has a fantastic actor behind them giving a stellar performance, and bro-Dionysus is one of my favorite gods. There's such life to each character, and the story wouldn't be the same without them. \\n\\nThe gameplay is so much fun. The variety of weapons and abilities creates limitless fighting styles and it is so exciting to play with different combos. Enemies are randomized across chambers and regions, but there are certain enemies that only appear in those regions (i.e. one specific type of ghost in region one, a different variation of the ghost in region two, etc) and the final bosses of the region are the same each time, with the same attacks and actions. Some may find this off-putting, but I like being able to learn their moves and kill them quickly instead of having new attacks I have to learn each time. \\n\\nThe little details in this game are enchanting. Certain rewards, cosmetic changes, and other smaller things help give this game another level of atmosphere that I adore. I simply can't recommend this game enough. A+++++, I've bought it for all my friends who put it on their wishlist because I want them to be able to experience it ASAP\",\n",

       " b\"I've purchased this game almost randomly during the sale. It looked nice, had a roguelite tag, it's store page was filled with positive reviews - why not? I have never played a Supergiant game before. Now I will! \\n\\nHades is a roguelite with an excellent audio/visual presentation, memorable characters and smooth gameplay. It's variety is not as huge as some other games in the genre (like Binding of Isaac), but it makes it up in gameplay department. I've enjoyed it way more than similar games. Something here just makes combat feel way more... meaty? Also, unlike many bullet hell-ish games, the combat is a mix between melee and ranged. There are purely ranged and purely melee weapons, but on most runs you'll use both. \\n\\nThe story in this game is a little bit overrated, as at it's core it is quite simple. Still, characters are great and there are tons of dialogue lines, for a roguelite game at least. You can develop your relationships with characters you like, although many of those relationships are still WIP. And there are some clever jokes and references, but not to the point it becomes a parody.\\n\\nAnother thing different to many other roguelites would be amount of randomness you can control. You get to choose which weapon you want to start with, and also can influence the upgrades you'll get during the run. \\n\\nOne of the weaker points of the game might be it's replayability. It has decent amount of upgrades, currently 5 (soon 6) weapons, each of which can be modified in 1 of the 3 ways. There are plenty of crazy builds you can attempt to make.

Ogni volta che verremo sconfitti, rinasceremo al cospetto di nostro padre e verremo puntualmente sbeffeggiati dagli npc sopracitati, evidenziando non solo l'impossibilit\\xc3\\xa0 dell'impresa, ma anche trattandoci da adolescenti cocciuti che prima poi cominceranno a fare gli uomini.\\n\\nPrima di cominciare ogni tentativo di fuga faremo puntualmente tappa nella nostra stanza e nell'armeria.\\n\\nLa camera, elegante e ricca di dettagli, nasconde lo specchio della notte, regalatoci dalla nostra matrigna Nyx, esso ci permette di attivare alcuni bonus mediante l'utilizzo delle chiavi che troveremo sparse per gli inferi.\\n\\nL'armeria, immediatamente adiacente alla Camera, ci da la possibilit\\xc3\\xa0 di provare tutte le armi che abbiamo al momento,  visualizzando i danni che rechiamo e provare eventuali combo. Oltre alle armi \\xc3\\xa8 presente anche un armadietto con tutti i regali che gli npc ci hanno fatto, possiamo equipaggiarli e nel men\\xc3\\xb9 possiamo vederne le caratteristiche e le condizioni per poterli migliorare.\\n\\nScelto il nostro setup possiamo lanciarci nella mischia.

Il tartaro viene raffigurato come un immenso labirinto, la struttura delle stanze \\xc3\\xa8 spesso diversa e tra trappole ed eventi casuali la nostra esplorazione risulter\\xc3\\xa0 ogni volta una nuova sfida, \\xc3\\xa8 che sfida!\\n\\nPer quanto il genere risulti ormai ampiamente esplorato, questo Hades sar\\xc3\\xa0 capace senza dubbio di stupirvi. Le possibilit\\xc3\\xa0 di crescita sono infinite e per quanto riuscirete a sentirvi forti e preparati il livello di sfida si impenner\\xc3\\xa0 sempre, sono un amante dei Roguelike lo sapete e se adesso ho voglia di spararmi un run in qualcosa, state certi che la mia scelta ricadr\\xc3\\xa0 su Hades.\",\n",

       " b'This might be early access but it definitely doesn\\'t feel like it, I have yet to encounter a bug and no part of the game progress feels unfinished, it seems like the devs have taken the good approach of completely finishing a feature before releasing it which is a really nice refresher given the usual nature of early access games.\\n\\nNow when it comes to the game itself I am pretty amazed. I do enjoy roguelites but typically I get bored of them relatively quickly because there isn\\'t much to push for except \"I hope I make it past X amount of levels this time\". This original approach of incorporating an actual narrative in a way that makes sense with the core roguelite concept (which is really just to try the same randomised dungeon over and over again) really gives this little extra incentive to keep playing since you don\\'t just grind for levels and gear but also for the story. Hence, I have never felt a stronger feeling of \"just one more run\" in any roguelite I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nGraphically the screenshots speak for themselves. The voice acting is on point, giving each character a clear personality. The music is intense and makes fights that much enjoyable, not that it really needed it because the gameplay is really solid.\\n\\nThe fights are fast paced and the various boons/upgrades you can collect (and combine) from the different gods do make you play the game in slightly different ways every run and the different weapons each require a completely different approach to your fighting style. Worth mentioning also that every weapon eventually can be transformed into variations of itself; although those variations are pretty much another layer god boons.\\n\\nThe only little thing I regret so far is that the character upgrade system feels a bit...bland? you don\\'t really unlock new abilities and most of the upgrades are passive bonuses such as +5HP, +10gold, +1% of having X happen which feels a tad boring although the devs did mention working on some changes so we\\'ll see.\\n\\nBut overall this is a solid game even in its early access state that I can only recommend.\\n',\n",

Death is a chance to grow stronger and go further. The weapon's are all unique and change up the gameplay in their own right. There is another weapon yet to come I'm looking forward to seeing! There is an element of RNG in perk selections, but skill can not be understated.  The lategame is setup brilliantly for an increasing challenge. This game does a great job of making you feel incredibly powerful, dare I say, godlike. And still find yourself crawling out of the Pool of Styx. Definitely a game you should try. I hope to see them put in more Gods and boons. The Long Winter was a great addition and makes me want more!\",\n",

       " b\"I won't stop recommending this game to my friends until they play it. If anyone on my friends list sees this review - play this game. It's in early access but the amount of content already there is incredible.\\n\\nI played around 50 runs in about a week and I'm not stopping there. The recency bias has long disappeared and I still love this game. Within the first 10 hours I added it to my favorites category and it will always have a place in my heart as one of my favorite games. \\n\\nThe lore is amazing, it gives a great twist on Greek Mythology while still being informative and entertaining. I got really invested into the characters and became interested in raising my affection with them after a while. They were exciting to talk to and I was willing to put a pause on my game play to listen to their amazing voice lines. \\n\\nThe combat is amazingly snappy and satisfying, packing punch behind every hit with almost every weapon. The bow I believe could use some work as it feels clunky, slow and the aspects are lackluster compared to other weapons aspects. I love how many options there are for damaging enemies: attacks, dashes, dash-attacks, charge-attacks, special-attacks, casts and calls are all divine to use. The synergies for all of these are functional and what you would expect, rarely breaking. Knock-back, chain-lightning, hangover, doom and deflection synergies are thrilling and dynamic in their game design while the stat-effect synergy weakness is less appealing. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is detailed and while sometimes overwhelming, eventually becomes more easily parsed, allowing for better play and less moments of confusion over taking damage. A nice touch that would help atmosphere wise would be to see the green aesthetic shades appear in a room after clearing the hostile shades in Tartarus. For Asphodel, my casts sometimes get lost in the bending and shadowed walls beyond the lava shores, making it annoying to interrupt the game play loop to increase overall damage output. In Elysium, the wall spear traps have divots that cause the player to get stuck between them, taking continual damage. This has happened less as I learned to stay away from the walls in Elysium, however, it interrupted the game play loop many times and was an overall frustrating addition.\\n\\nI can visualize this game becoming a sensation and defining title among the rogue-like genre; If Hades continues adding new content and possibly more replay-ability in alternate path(s), compelling endings and delicious synergies, it will definitely become a classic I will return to for years and years.\\n\\n[table]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th][b]Category[/b][/th]\\n        [th][b]Rating[/b][/th]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Combat[/td]\\n        [td]9/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Lore[/td]\\n        [td]8/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Atmosphere[/td]\\n        [td]7/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Performance[/td]\\n        [td]10/10[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table]\",\n",

It took me a long time to get to the end and even after I have enjoyed every run to further make myself stronger for future content. I am STILL working to get everything maxed. \\n\\nI also want to give a special shout out to Darren Korb. He\\'s the guy who made the majority of the music. I very much appreciate the entire sound track. I find myself to regularly having the song \"Good Riddance\" in my head and appreciate the emotion behind the \"Lament of Orpheus\". All of the other songs...I wish I had more bass in my head phones to really rock out to it.',\n",

       " b\"This game is a blast. Seriously, I'm not even particularly a fan of rogue-likes, but it has been a while since I had so much fun with a game. The characters you meet are plenty and unique, the story, albeit unfinished is engaging and the combat is a goddamn pleasure.\\n\\nWhat I particularly enjoy is the very meaningful character progression. You can improve yourself between each game, you can also customize your weapons and eventually add conditions to make the game more challenging and earn better rewards. I also like the way you gather godly boons during a game which can lead to amazing combos and completely change the way you play between two games. It makes each game feel fresh and unique.\\n\\nIt's in early access, regularly updated and already extremely solid. I wholeheartedly recommand it.\",\n",

       " b\"I came into the game two months ago at a bad time, it wasn't long after a major update and it would be some time still before another major update. Not to mention despite the difficulty my continuous play of it made it easy for me to memorize and get around enemies and bosses with the right gear.\\n\\nHaving said that, I love this game. Rogue likes in general are my favorite genre besides RPG's, I only sank 14.4 hours into this game but I did not leave because I was tired. This game is one I want to see succeed because it is genuinely an amazing game and so much fun to play, I did not want to review it when I came in. \\n\\nInstead I'd rather wait till now when a major update came out not too long ago that added bunches of more hours and more ways to play the game. If you want something to sink some time into that's fun and not multiplayer this is your game, and I highly recommend you check this out.\",\n",

       " b'Gets boring pretty fast. I haven\\'t played many roguelikes, but I expected a bit more variety in enemies, rooms and \"viable\" power ups. Yes, there\\'s almost infinite possibilities for combining boons from different gods, but a lot of those combos aren\\'t really good, so you\\'re always hoping for a few boons and upgrades to show up every run.\\n\\nThe game is also kind of easy and although you can increase the difficulty via a few mechanics, it\\'s still very boring to keep repeating the same thing with tiny differences each time. I think it\\'s a good game if you enjoy grinding endlessly and aren\\'t really bothered by SLOWLY getting stronger while fighting the same enemies every 10 to 30 minutes. The story is cool, but also irrelevant (you can probably skip every dialogue and still understand the game just fine).\\n\\nAll in all, I find it hard to justify going back to the game at this point and even \"major\" updates haven\\'t improved that feeling by more than a couple runs for me.

       " b\"Fantastic game, tons of replayability, 130+ hours in, and still not tired of the game. Each run can be wildly different based on your luck, and the game is in a pretty good state despite the early access tag. Game play is highly polished, and could easily pass as a fully developed game. Hell, even better than some fully developed games. The game don't feel overly hard, and feels like its in a good state of balance right now. As you play you'll get better at the game and a basic run is simply a breeze after awhile, between the upgrades and the player getting better. But that doesn't make the game boring as you can scale up the difficulty, which makes the game even more satisfying when you clear a high difficulty run, after dozens of attempts.\\n\\nThe dialogs in the game is deep and characters have great developments. At the end of each run, heading back to the house is a treat of itself. Despite spending so much time on the game, there's still some dialogs with the NPCs that surprised me, speaks volume of how much effort was put into the game. With each major update, not only are there some game play changes, there's even updates to the NPCs interaction that just absolutely delightful.\\n\\nThe developers is always listening to the community feedback, and is constantly improving the game. Can't wait for the next major update that's gonna add a lot more contents.\",\n",

       " b\"This game is insane!! It's in early access, but it's more finished and polished than a lot of other games coming out with their full (or fully broken) release.\\n\\nI have longed for a hack&slash with a combat system like this. Although Hades isn't a traditional hack&slash, I don't know why it cannot fall into that category, at least in a broader sense: you crawl through a dungeon and kill monsters over and over. Except with a different concept, you don't find items but buffs instead. And instead of creating a new character to experience a new fighting style, in Hades you simply start a new run and everything is different and you adapt on the way. The focus is also on your fighting, not gear or skilltree.\\n\\nThe story isn't forced on you or given to you on a silver platter. You can engage in it by talking with NPCs and you get their perspective on things (everytime you die and take a break from fighting). Which makes it highly believable and intriguing.\\n\\nI had a ton of fun. Money well spent. Refund your WC3 Reforged and get this instead, you'll end up being happier.\",\n",

       " b'Hades is easily one of the most fun games I\\'ve played in the last few years, and it\\'s not even done yet! The chamber-to-chamber movement, with a reward after each encounter, keeps the gameplay loop fresh and exciting even after you\\'ve been playing for hours. Combat leans toward fast-paced, dodge-intensive fights, but you can also get options to play safer and whittle down enemies if that\\'s how you prefer to play. In fact, I think what I love so much about Hades is that there doesn\\'t seem to be a lot of \"bad\" choices or builds; with practice and patience you can probably finish the game with just about any combination of weapon, boons, and trinket. The boons(upgrades that are lost if you die) all have a place and a situation where you\\'ll say \"Yeah, I can use that,\" and as you gain permanent upgrades that increase your boons\\' rarity(which affects the boon\\'s base power and allows access to more effects) and items that let you manipulate which god will give you their boon first, you can create more consistent runs with a more specific set of boons, or you can keep leaving everything to chance to keep to the roguelike spirit of the game. You will get destroyed on your first few runs, but once you get the hang of it, earn some upgrades, and make some offerings to your favorite characters, you\\'ll be hooked. \\n\\nWith a Supergiant game, it\\'s maybe unnecessary to point out the game delivers just as much on aesthetics as on gameplay. The Underworld is colorful and beautiful without compromising on being literal hell, the character designs are excellent, and the soundtrack by Darren Korb is fire. Even if you don\\'t end up playing Hades, the soundtrack is on Spotify and Youtube and is well worth a listen. \\n\\nFinally, the writing of the game is really good. You play as Zagreus, the son of Hades, the god of the Greek afterlife, and between dying painfully to traps and monsters scattered throughout the underworld, you have chances to talk to figures from Greek mythology like Achilles, Orpheus, and Cerberus(yes, you *can* pet the dog). You\\'ll learn more about each character over time, as well as uncover more about why exactly Zagreus is willing to risk his life over and over to escape Hades, and what has the gods on Olympus so interested in helping him break out. The story is not finished at the time of writing this review; but I\\'m very interested in seeing what happens in future updates.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be hard-pressed to find another Early Access game that feels, looks, and sounds as good as Hades. Buy it. 10/10\\n',\n",

       " b\"Hades is the next masterpiece crafted by SuperGiant Games.\\n\\nAgain, they deliver through action, visuals, storytelling and music. All of it is great. The mechanics are interesting and offer what is for me an addictive rogue-like type gameplay. Usually I am not that much of a fan of rogue-likes and I tend to lose interest because it doesn't feel like there is real progression. But with Hades... You really get this feeling of: *just one more try*. Or you wanna try something new or different on your next run. There is many ways to play this game and approach your playstyle. Plus, the game offers more than just repetitive runs. There are other characters that are interesting to get to know, and each have something to offer.\\n\\nSome might say that the story is not as strong as their other games', as it is not completely original like before but based on greek mythology. Sure, but I feel like this lets them focus more of the game itself; and the game IS a whole lot fun. Besides, the story is still fun and interesting enough to keep your interests peaked.\\n\\nIn short: if you like SuperGiant's previous games, than this is your next buy. Into rogue-likes or (isometric) action games? Definitely worth a buy.\",\n",

Artwork, sound effects, responsive gameplay, characters, voice acting, oh my god the soundtracks all on point. Darren Korb is a magician. It would say Hades gone far and beyond even though the previous titles were already set a very high bar. It has insane replayability and even when you keep resetting you feel like you are progressing at just the right amount. \\n\\nHades feels incredibly responsive. Soundtracks are amazing as usual.

Instead, you play using whatever skills and powers you have at the moment and get yourself as deep into the dungeon as you possibly can. Then you die. And dying is fun. Cause every time you resurrect, you gain the chance to get new powers and you can purchase new skills. And you start all over again - literally, all... over... again - level 1. Usually, starting from scratch every single time you die doesn't sound like much fun. But that's the beauty of rogue-lite games. The maps are dynamic, you never really get the same challenges again. It's always a little different, with new cut scenes and dialogue with the gods and such. In this game, you look FORWARD to dying. Some even die purposely... go figure. \\n\\nFor anyone wondering is it worth getting at early access? YES! It's 30 hours of fun, at the very least. And when you stop, you just can't stop thinking about maybe beating that bastard one more time...\",\n",

       " b\"If you looked at my review history, you could see that I have actually downvoted every single Supergiant Games game I've ever played. I've always been really unsatisfied with their generic plotlines and repetitive (near the endgame) level designs. I really have never been encouraged to play any of their games for very long. And none of their games felt very replayable to me. I've conceded that their voice acting, their ability to TELL stories, and their art is really high quality- but their story-oriented games were lacking in story, in my opinion.  Finally, I think they really hit the jackpot with this game. \\n\\nNot only is the gameplay engaging, but the story is honestly really unique and interesting. The gameplay is your stereotypical sort of roguelike dungeon crawler (think Enter the Gungeon), but the story really keeps me engaged. The characters are interesting and fleshed out, as well. So far, all the weapons seem balanced. I really have no complaints. I love the art, the voice acting, the plot, the characters, the gameplay- everything. \\n\\nIf you loved all their previous games, I don't know if you'd like this one because it's really very different. If you like roguelikes, I think this is really a top-tier competitor. And for the higher pricetag, I think this really holds a lot of potential for play if you like those sorts of games. I love it and I'm only a few hours in so far. I just felt the need to give a review because I really did not have huge expectations for this game. The only reason I bought it is because I really wanted a new rogelike and I figured it was pretty different than Supergiant's previous games. I think they really did a great job with this one.\",\n",
